.TH ks 1 "5 Feb 2022" "0.0.20.0-Man1.1" "Kernel Simulator"
.SH NAME
ks \- simulates our future-planned kernel 
.SH SYNOPSIS
ks [args]
.SH DESCRIPTION
ks is the launcher for Kernel Simulator, which simulates our kernel that will be done in the future. It provides the built-in simulated kernel, log-in software, shell, and a set of useful tools like the FTP client, SSH, IMAP shell, etc. It also features the filesystem and basic operations like list, cp(1), mv(1), etc.
.SH OPTIONS
It only takes an argument of the executable arguments, which will be described below in the next section. Actually, there are two types of arguments:
.SH SYSTEM ARGUMENTS
In Kernel Simulator, when it starts, it checks for command line arguments to see if they are passed or not, and if so, will execute the following:
.TP 4
.B testInteractive
Initializes the test shell where you can test several features of the kernel or the programs that are shipped inside the simulated system. When you exit the shell, it exits the application.
.TP 4
.B debug
Enables the debug functionality in the kernel. It enables the local debugging feature which lets the kernel log all debugging messages to a file in your user profile. It also enables the remote debugging feature that lets you see debugging messages remotely from another computer.
.TP 4
.B args
When started with this argument, it lets the kernel prompt you to specify kernel arguments. Notice that the kernel arguments and KS arguments are not the same.
.SH KERNEL ARGUMENTS
In Kernel Simulator, when it starts, it checks for kernel arguments to see if they are passed or not, and if so, will execute the following:
.TP 4
.B cmdinject
Injects a command into the kernel so when the user is logged in, will automatically executed the injected commands given.
.TP 4
.B debug
Enables the debug functionality in the kernel. It enables the local debugging feature which lets the kernel log all debugging messages to a file in your user profile. It also enables the remote debugging feature that lets you see debugging messages remotely from another computer.
.TP 4
.B maintenance
Enters the maintenance mode where the only user is root. It's akin to Linux maintenance, albeit more strict.
.TP 4
.B quiet
Suppresses the boot messages until the kernel has finished starting up.
.TP 4
.B safe
Enters the safe mode where all the mods are disabled. You can't start mods up in this mode until you reboot to the normal mode.
.TP 4
.B testInteractive
Opens the test shell prior to starting the kernel up
.SH PRE-BOOT COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
In Kernel Simulator, when it starts, it checks for the pre-boot command line arguments to see if they are passed or not, and if so, will execute the following:
.TP 4
.B bypasssizedetection
Bypasses the console size detection (checks to see if the console is a 80x24 form) and starts KS right away, although it gives you a chance to resize the window.
.TP 4
.B reset
Resets the configuration
