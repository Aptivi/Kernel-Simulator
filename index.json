    "keywords": "What is Kernel Simulator? Kernel Simulator is an application which simulates our future-planned kernel as we've imagined it. It has all the usual applications, including filesystem manipulation, kernel mods, basic scripting, and many more awesome features. What is this web page? This webpage is not a wiki for the general use of Kernel Simulator; it's an API documentation for mod developers to be used as reference. It constantly gets updated as we push the updates to the main and servicing versions of Kernel Simulator. If you still intend to use a documentation specific to your preferred version of KS, you may refer to the releases page of the project and download the attached 0.0.x.y-doc.rar file. To get started using the documentation, select KS API from the top menu and select a namespace to get a clear overview of the API that Kernel Simulator provides. Feedback If you wish to leave feedback to us about this API reference website, use the issue tracker of the project. If you wish to contribute to the documentation of the API, go to the Kernel Simulator source code and make your improvements there on a draft Pull Request ; we don't support override files that are made by clicking on Improve this doc . Any meaningful contributions are welcome. Copyright (c) 2018 - 2022 Aptivi and its companies. All rights reserved."

An argument to the kernel is the option of which the kernel or parts of it will behave differently based on the options you have chosen. It will be run on the start of the kernel, and if no arguments were specified, the kernel will run normally. You can run arguments on the next reboot by using the arginj command when on shell. You can make the prompt appear in two methods: By changing config option Prompt for Arguments on Boot to True (For more information about config, see Kernel Configuration ) By running Kernel Simulator with the promptArgs cmdline argument (eg. \"Kernel Simulator.exe\" promptArgs ) You can separate multiple argument with commas without spaces. For example, quiet,safe Useful arguments Argument Description safe Disables custom mods and screensavers.

    "keywords": "Commands for KS The commands in the entirety of the kernel are programs that allow you to do what they're supposed to do. They can be either implemented internally (which is what we call the normal commands), implemented as an alias (an alias to normal commands or mods), or created by mods. All the shells (either normal or custom) share a common command input parser, such as arguments, switches, and so on. Some commands have arguments (either required, for which you should provide to make the command work, or optional, for which you can omit), and some don't provide any. The switches are special arguments that have the dash in front of them. They change how the commands work, but must be implemented before they actually work. General commands These commands that are mentioned below are available in all of the shells. Command Description exit Exits the subshell presets Changes the shell preset UESH shell commands The below commands for Kernel Simulator can be used in the normal UESH shell, the one that is started after you log in to your account. For more information about every command, click the command. Administrative commands Important The user must have at least the administrative privileges before they can run the below commands. Command Description adduser You can add the user's name whenever you need, with the password if required. However, passwords are required to ensure security. alias You can manage your aliases to commands so you don't have to type long commands. arginj You can inject arguments into the kernel so that when you reboot, the arguments that are injected will be run. blockdbgdev You can block an IP address of a debug device to prevent it from entering remote debug until it's unblocked. cdbglog You can clear debug log, resetting the size to 0 chhostname You can change your hostname of your kernel to personalize things. It has an argument of chhostname <AnyHostName>. chlang Changes your language chmal You can change your message of the day after login, and it supports the same placeholders. chmotd You can change your message of the day, and you can include your own placeholders, including <user> which stands for username, <shortdate> for the short date in \"MM/DD/YYYY\" format, <longdate> for the long date that looks like \"Saturday, December 1, 2018\", <shorttime> for the short time in \"HH:MM\" format, <longtime> for the long time in \"HH:MM:SS AM/PM\" format, <timezone> for the standard time zone (eg. Egypt Standard Time), <summertimezone> for the daylight time zone name (eg. Syria Daylight Time). chpwd You can change your password, or someone else's password. chusrname You can change your username, or someone else's name, although if you changed your own username to new name, you'll be signed out immediately. disconndbgdev Disconnects a debug device langman Manage languages lsdbgdev Lists all debug devices that are connected modman Manages your mods netinfo You can check your network status and network interface information, including WiFi support.

    "keywords": "Custom splash guide What is the custom splash for the kernel? The custom splash is an assembly file that loads before the splash is displayed. It allows you to create custom splashes from simple progress bars to complex console art. Tip To get started to our Kernel Simulator API, visit this page . Custom splash format The mods have the file extension of .dll , and can support more than one code file for each mod. This will allow you to make bigger mods that can't fit on one source file, or if you want to separate some parts of the big source code to multiple fragments. How to start your own custom splash on Visual Studio? Note We recommend following the template repository for making your own mod here . If you're going to make your custom splash, follow these steps: On the Start Page, click on New Project Click on Class Library (.NET Framework) or Class Library , select VB or C#, and name your splash. Select Framework as .NET Framework 4.8 or .NET 6.0 . When you're finished, click Create . Right-click on References in the Solution Explorer, and press Manage NuGet packages... Go to Browse , and find Kernel Simulator and install it. You will see that your KS executable files are added to the references. In your project file, this will be added: <PackageReference Include=\"KS\"> <Version>0.0.21.1</Version> </PackageReference> The code will be ready in your SplashName codefile: Public Class SplashName 'Your code here End Class Now, follow these steps to create your first mod: Between the Public Class... and the End Class lines, let Visual Studio know that you're going to create your KS mod by writing: Implements ISplash Define properties for mod information by putting below the Implements ISplash: (Change the values as appropriate) Property SplashClosing As Boolean Implements ISplash.SplashClosing Property ProgressWritePositionX As Integer Implements ISplash.ProgressWritePositionX Property ProgressWritePositionY As Integer Implements ISplash.ProgressWritePositionY Property ProgressReportWritePositionX As Integer Implements ISplash.ProgressReportWritePositionX Property ProgressReportWritePositionY As Integer Implements ISplash.ProgressReportWritePositionY Property SplashDisplaysProgress As Boolean Implements ISplash.SplashDisplaysProgress Property ISplash.SplashName As String Implements ISplash.SplashName Make your opening splash sub named Opening() that implements the ISplash.Opening, by writing: Sub Opening() Implements ISplash.Opening 'Your code below End Sub Replace every 'Your code below comment with your code. Repeat this step on all the interface subs Make your display splash sub named Display() that implements the ISplash.Display, by writing: Sub Display() Implements ISplash.Display 'Your code below End Sub Make your progress report splash sub named Report() that implements the ISplash.Report, by writing: Sub Report(Progress As Integer, ProgressReport As String, ProgressWritePositionX As Integer, ProgressWritePositionY As Integer, ProgressReportWritePositionX As Integer, ProgressReportWritePositionY As Integer, ParamArray Vars() As Object) Implements ISplash.Report 'Your code below End Sub Make your closing splash sub named Closing() that implements the ISplash.Closing, by writing: Sub Closing() Implements ISplash.Closing 'Your code below End Sub Right-click on the solution and press Build. Copy the output .dll file to KSSplashes directory in your profile folder ( /home/<user>/ in Linux, and Users\\<user>\\ in Windows) Run your Kernel Simulator you've just referenced to in your project, and set it to display your splash using the settings command. Be sure to reboot the kernel. Optional Stuff You can make your subs anywhere on the class, but if: they're on the different class, make a separate code file for it: Public Class AnotherClass 'Your definitions below, and so your subs, functions, interfaces, etc. End Class The new subs or functions should meet the following conditions: They shouldn't make an infinite loop unless you're making them that exits if specified conditions are met They shouldn't try to cause errors with the kernel. If you're an exploiter and are making the exploit code for the splash implementation, do so on your test environment first then the production environment, then make your CVE report so we get attention and fix that quickly. If you're going to add imports, these rules must be met: Don't import \"KS\" by itself. KS does that automatically When importing modules/classes like TextWriterColor, it's written like this: Imports KS.Misc.Writers.TextWriterColor Examples If you want to check out the examples, feel free to check them out in the KSModExamples respository in GitHub."

The revision can be either SemVer2-compliant, date and time, build number, or just the mod version. -TITLE:Your manual title -REVISION:1.0 Body The contents of the manual page must be surrounded by the -BODY START- and the -BODY END- tags to signify that they are actually shown in the mod manual viewer. Take a look at the example below to show what was meant to be: -BODY START- This is a body for the simplistic manual page for your mod. You can use placeholders in it. -BODY END- Comments Of course, all the comments are ignored and are not shown, whether it's on the body or not. They are to clarify some points on the developer's side. These comments start with the ~~- tag and the text follows it. If you want to specify a TODO to indicate that the work isn't finished yet, you may do so by writing ~~- TODO: . These tasks are shown in the kernel prior to displaying the body. Comments outside body ~~- All comments are ignored by the parser. ~~- TODO: Needs work Comments inside body -BODY START- ~~- All comments in body are ignored by the parser. ~~- TODO: Clarify point 2 -BODY END- Personalization You can even use the placeholders to personalize your manual page. Consult the Placeholders page for more information about how to use them in manual pages. -BODY START- <f:4>Hello world! in color!<f:reset> -BODY END- Installation To install the manual page to your mod, create a folder in KSMods the mod DLL name with .manual appended to the end (for example, mod.dll.manual ). Put all your .man files inside the folder (for example, manual.man ). The structure should look like this: KSMods/ | +-> mod.dll +-> mod.dll.manual/ | +-> manual.man Run Kernel Simulator, log-in to your account, and write modman <manual title> . If your manual title is enclosed in spaces, you may surround the title with the double quotes, for example, modman \"First Mod Manual\" ."

The debugging output will be the same as the output file, but missing all the messages before you connected. The first message you will get is Debug device <LocalIP> joined . It not only provides facilities to look at the debug output live, but you can also chat with the other debuggers to discuss about the current problem that happened, like asking questions, and more. How can I connect to debug? Since all the connections are established using the raw text mode, there's no need to authenticate. All you need is the IP address of the remote machine and the port, 3014. If you don't know what tool do you need to have on your system, follow the instructions with your platform. Linux/Unix systems Install netcat using your package manager (e.g. sudo apt install netcat ) Instruct nc/netcat to connect to your debug machine to remotely debug (e.g. nc <LocalIP> 3014 ) Windows systems Install PuTTY Open it, set the connection mode to Raw, and write the IP address and the port. Click on Open to see debugging messages on another machine."

    "keywords": "History of KS 2018 Pre-release Before the release of 0.0.1.0, we were working on the PowerPoint OS collection almost 2 years ago (as of 2019), and that used VBA (VB6) macros on Office 2007. While we were working on it, the macro wasn't maintainable thanks to the restrictions of Visual Basic 6, so we have cancelled it. In that way, we have learned how to develop VB.NET, and started to think about the kernels, and because it's impossible to make a bootable kernel except that if we have Cosmos, we have done the simulator that does the equivalent way of booting. We wrote the kernel booting procedure, log-in, and the shell which includes commands, making that four source code files compared to now. When we finished, we have initialized our Git repository sitting around the Aptivi account on GitHub as our coding management system, because it isn't right to release the GNU GPL software WITHOUT the source code. Big releases Big releases are releases that has 12+ exact changes or more changes. When the change amount in the version is 24+ or more, it's considered as \"Huge\" update. If possible, every 4 releases could be a Big update, or a Huge update. But these updates might dramatically increase the size of the executable, depending on the number of the striking changes made. To consider it as a big or huge release, the third part of the version that is divided by 4 should be the number that doesn't have the decimal point, the first release which meets the third version part rule may claim this title, and the striking changes should be more than 12. 5/23/2018 We published the 0.0.4.1 version publicly in case there is an HDD failure. After that, we are trying to learn more about kernels, and how are they built, using old Linux CD-ROMs, and the one happened to be Mandrake Linux, was downloading. On our Android tablet, the Internet connection slowed down, so we went to pause a download, hoping that it goes fine. Whenever we paused the game, we went into the computer, and saw that the download paused, like usual. We saw the HDD light always being on, and also the WiFi light. We tried to move the mouse but we can't, so we did the hard reboot and now our development environment started to get bluescreens during the startup. We then tried the Hiren's Boot CD's Mini Windows XP, and that booted successfully. Yet when it tried to access the faulty hard drive, we're hearing clicks and at the same time, MiniXP hangs. We managed to open the CMD and we have run the chkdsk program with /F. We saw that it has scanned for errors and fixed them, and when we restarted again, everything went fine. See more at https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/677922/windows-xp-sp3-reboot-cycle-crashes-often-on-boot/ (Thread is hot - According to bleepingcomputer.com, it says that the topic is created at 5/22/2018 when the failure happened at 5/23/2018.) 5/24/2018 to 5/27/2018 We tried again by going to our OS, but things messed up after installing and uninstalling AVIRA Antivirus because of its instability with the non-SSE2 processors. The boot up slowed down, the hard drive clicking noise appeared when we're trying to access Firefox, and we got the blue screen showing that it crashed because the critical process is killed. We went into MiniXP again, and we tried to get the SMART info using gsmartcontrol latest version, but it reported that it didn't have the dwmapi.dll. The dwmapi.dll is for Windows Vista and up. We tried again using CrystalDiskInfo, but it didn't print the information properly. We quickly backed up all of the important data to another working drive that is connected in the past 2-3 years from the spare computer that failed to boot. We also tried to test the drive by using the Western Digital diagnostic utility, but the quick test failed immediately, so it suggests that the hard drive failure is imminent. We tried the long test, it found bad sectors! We tried to repair it, but we got an error saying that bad sectors didn't get fixed, so the drive is failing. On the final day of the HDD that has the super-customized Windows XP OS, the drive failed completely after that, and all the portion of the OS and programs, including the XPize dark theme (Royale?), Windows Sidebar for XP, Visual Basic 2010 (old), Firefox, and all of the programs we tried hard to get and customize, including the OS font settings like Ubuntu, Segoe UI, Source Sans, etc., sound settings, mouse settings, the custom bootscreen, and so on, are lost forever, because the BIOS won't detect that drive. This is an indication that the HDD has died. It reached the expected 5 years of death. See more at: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/678191/windows-xp-sp3-slow-booting-unusual-hdd-activity-with-noise-then-bsod/ (Thread is hot) 5/28/2018 After the drive has died, we decided to unplug the dead drive from the computer, and set the working drive settings to Master, we went into Hiren's BootCD's Partition Magic, and set up appropriate settings so that we have 2 partitions without wiping our data drive. After that, we installed Windows XP and configured everything as appropriate, as long as we didn't wipe everything on the data partition, because if it was wiped, then all of the hard work are lost forever. We set up VB2010 as appropriate. Use of libraries We tried to make everything as simple as possible, but the config one turns out to have all the writers. We decided to download the MadMilkman.Ini library and install it into KS, and we re-wrote the config writers to the library ones. The 0.0.5.5 version didn't use NuGet to get libraries, because from the 0.0.1, we're using the VB2010 on Windows XP development environment. But, there is no working NuGet package manager for VB2010 because support has ended, and instead, they provide downloads for VS2015, and VS2017, at the time of writing. However, 0.0.5.5 still supports Windows XP. The support for Unix systems When we're developing KS, we stumbled upon the Mono project, and it said that it has support for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. MonoDevelop doesn't check for mistakes on the code when you're coding, but does check when you're building. We recommend JetBrains Rider for Linux 64-bit systems, because it can check for code for errors LIVE like Visual Studio for Windows, Visual Studio Code for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and unlike MonoDevelop. Rider can also check for spelling mistakes in strings, while VS2017, VS Code, and MonoDevelop can't. The .NET for Mono project however is experimental at this time, but both MonoDevelop and Rider use it. So, we have loaded the project into MonoDevelop, but when we built the project, we got 3 warnings. We fixed them all, but the hardware probing step crashed, because there is no WMI for Linux or Mac, because WMI is only meant for Windows. After we removed the hardware initialization statement from Kernel.vb, the kernel started up, but there's another problem. Although Mono's Console.Write(Line) can parse arguments correctly, W(ln) can't. However, it's fixed in later versions. We made everything as necessary to fix this problem, and it succeeded. We fixed other crashing or exception (AmbiguousMatchException) problems. The new development looks We began development of 0.0.5.9 in VB2010 Express and Windows XP, and used the MadMilkman.Ini, FluentFTP and Newtonsoft.Json libraries by getting in normal way. Meanwhile, one of our libraries were severely outdated and should be updated to track the progress bar of upload and download progress. But we couldn't get the NuGet package manager for VB2010 because the download was failing although the Internet was working and can access sites fine. We have dual-booted Windows XP with Windows 7 and tried to install VS2017, but it appears that the Installer crashed (Not the installer where it downloads 60 MB of data and unpacking them, but used for installing VS2017). The installer was called \"Visual Studio Installer\" and you can use it to install VS2017, modify it, or uninstall it at your own needs without having to re-run the setup tool. We then suspected it was vs_installer.exe trying to access illegal instructions in our non-SSE2 AMD Athlon XP 1500+, so we have tried VS2015, and it worked. The NuGet package manager worked successfully. We have moved our KS 0.0.5.9 source code to Windows 7 before accessing them in VS2015. We removed all old libraries using the outdated way and began using NuGet to put dependency libraries into KS, and we got the latest version of FluentFTP. What's good is that NuGet can update packages. We completed the coding, and we tried to put it to GitHub using the GitHub extension in VS Community, but it failed to work because the devenv.exe tried to access SSE2 instructions, so VS2015 crashed. After several crashes, we got a laptop running Windows 10 on it, and moved all the KS files into it, but 3-4 files were lost, and one of them is GetCommand.vb, which parses commands. We re-wrote these 3-4 files, and they worked successfully like the last time we extended them to have 0.0.5.9 features. 2019 Truth about status probing When we were developing KS 0.0.4.5, we have added Status for RAM and for HDD to indicate that they're OK, or if they're failing. But, the readings for the RAM were always \"Unknown\", and we thought that the HDD status probing was a bit redundant, so we have removed them in this release. We thought that this was an accidental addition, and due to it being so early, so the status was redundant and will likely be added in the future. Linux probing We are using the /proc/cpuinfo file to get information about the processor (name and clock), the /proc/meminfo file to get total memory that is installed in the system, and inxi application to get information about hard drives. But, not all distros install inxi by default, so if you don't have it installed, probing will fail. In order to install, follow below: Debian, and its derivatives: # apt update # apt install inxi Red Hat, and its derivatives: # dnf/yum install epel-release (?) # dnf/yum install inxi (?) OpenSUSE, and its derivatives: # zypper install inxi (?) Arch Linux, and its derivatives: # pacman -Syu (?) # pacman -i inxi (?) The rest, build from source and put the executable file into /usr/bin since the prober only looks in that directory, or use your package managers to install it. (?): Untested. If anybody tested, send a PR to edit this manual page with the correct commands. KS is now inside GitHub Package Registry Beta Congratulations to us because we got access to GitHub Package Registry Beta. Now, we have three sources instead of two, which are the following: Chocolatey Gallery, NuGet, and GitHub Package Registry. 2020 Truth about sound libraries Several releases ago, we have released speak and soundtest commands using NAudio as the library to handle sounds. It has worked fine in our test environment that's running Windows. We have assumed that everything is fine, until we've done the following: Testing these commands for Linux compatibility Apparently, because NAudio is only for Windows for its core functions such as playing audio, it doesn't work for Linux because it tries to locate mfplat.dll which is non-existent for non-Windows systems. So, we've changed the library that handles sound to VLC in 0.0.8, and it appears to work normally in Windows until it's time to test its compatibility on Linux systems. It has proven that it only worked on one command, soundtest , and didn't work on the other, speak . We didn't know the reason behind this error until we've found out that a console app, which is part of Linux's VLC, can play sounds, so we've used that and tested it, and it worked fine. However, when we went to test it on Windows systems whilst developing 0.0.11, it stopped working on the speak command. Because there is an instability while the core tries to load the native library for Windows systems, which causes the You haven't installed the package which provides the native library... error message to appear, even when installed. We've double-checked that we have that native library for Windows systems. Today, we didn't believe that both commands can be stable, so we've decided to shut down those commands as part of the 0.0.11 changes, which resulted in us not having to ship two types of binary packages: Full, and Isolated. We're back to one type: Full! Just before the 0.0.8 packaging method! As a result, the build times are faster and doesn't use too much I/O during the build, because of NuGet packaging task during it. The Truth of SSH.NET 2020.0.0 Beta 1 In development versions of 0.0.12.0, we've upgraded SSH.NET to 2020.0.0-beta1 hoping that it would someday have a full release for the SSH library that Kernel Simulator uses. When we've reached the final version of 0.0.12, we've seen that SSH.NET is still on 2020.0.0-beta1 instead of continuing development, so we've left it. After we've released 0.0.12.1, we've tested installing KS from NuGet, and we've seen an error message about SSH.NET, so we've installed 2020.0.0-beta1 first, then installed KS, and found that NuGet installed it successfully. Because this brings extra steps and we wanted simplicity, we've decided to downgrade SSH.NET to 2016.1.0 as its latest stable version. Goodbye, directory structure parsing We have let KS parse the entire directory structure since the actual file system was implemented on 0.0.5.14, which is a pre-release version of 0.0.6. The InitFS() (previously Init() ) function involved initializing the file structure by parsing the entire Home directory and all its subdirectories and files. We thought this is good, but over time, its usage (not the entire FS, but its structures) starts to decrease. Examples are listed below: You have SetCurrDir() that doesn't use the FS structure list to see if the folder exists or not You have copy command that uses {Directory|File}.Exists() to check for directory or file existence You have md command that uses Directory.Exists() to check for directory existence You have read command that uses File.Exists() to check for file existence Also, the filesystem structures are initialized every startup and every directory change. This causes additional load on the hard drive, especially on the first cold startup, making startup times longer than usual. The problem gets worse if your filesystem is too big and contains many directories and files, as it scans the entire directory, files, the subdirectories, and what's inside them. If this happens, then it's like you're telling the hard drive to read the entire directory structure. We have fears of hard drives thrashing, especially the SSDs that they have read and write limits and if exceeded, would no longer work properly, so we have to put an end to the directory structure parsing function. If this happens, the below happens: Hard drive usage will be decreased Faster start-up times Faster directory change Increases the lifespan of both hard drives and SSDs Removal history Removed filesystem parsing according to commit a9fc2de6"

    "keywords": "Introduction to the Kernel What is the Kernel? How about Kernel Simulator? The kernel in general is a computer program that is the core of a computer's operating system, with complete control over everything in the system. On most systems, it is one of the first programs loaded on start-up (after the bootloader). It handles the rest of start-up as well as input/output requests from software, translating them into data-processing instructions for the central processing unit. It handles memory and peripherals like keyboards, monitors, printers, and speakers. However Kernel Simulator is the actual first Simulation, and not Emulation, app that can simulate these kinds of behaviors, except it's limited as we're still in the Alpha stage, and it's also showing you the transition on how is our kernel improved and built over time. Starting from 0.0.5.6, we have implemented support for kernel simulation under Unix systems. The first version is extremely limited, and so we can use it as an example on how the kernel was built. The first version can also be fit on the diskettes as it doesn't exceed 1.44MB floppy disk limits. You can even sell the floppy disk of our simulator to your local computing museum for everyone to see how the kernel was first built. The history of Unix and Linux. What is Unix? and what happened in the past? Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. Initially intended for use inside the Bell System, AT&T licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s, leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of California, Berkeley (BSD), Microsoft (Xenix), IBM (AIX), and Sun Microsystems (Solaris). In the early 1990s, AT&T sold its rights in Unix to Novell, which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) in 1995. The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group, a neutral industry consortium, which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification (SUS). As of 2014, the Unix version with the largest installed base is Apple's macOS. The origins of Unix date back to the mid-1960s when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell Labs, and General Electric were developing Multics, a time-sharing operating system for the GE-645 mainframe computer. Multics featured several innovations, but also presented severe problems. Frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics, but not by its goals, individual researchers at Bell Labs started withdrawing from the project. The last to leave were Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna, who decided to reimplement their experiences in a new project of smaller scale. This new operating system was initially without organizational backing, and also without a name. The new operating system was a single-tasking system. In 1970, the group coined the name Unics for Uniplexed Information and Computing Service (pronounced eunuchs), as a pun on Multics, which stood for Multiplexed Information and Computer Services. Brian Kernighan takes credit for the idea, but adds that no one can remember the origin of the final spelling Unix. Dennis Ritchie, Doug McIlroy, and Peter G. Neumann also credit Kernighan. The operating system was originally written in assembly language, but in 1973, Version 4 Unix was rewritten in C. Version 4 Unix, however, still had many PDP-11 dependent codes, and is not suitable for porting. The first port to other platform was made five years later (1978) for Interdata 8/32. Bell Labs produced several versions of Unix that are collectively referred to as Research Unix. In 1975, the first source license for UNIX was sold to Donald B. Gillies at the University of Illinois Department of Computer Science. UIUC graduate student Greg Chesson, who had worked on the UNIX kernel at Bell Labs, was instrumental in negotiating the terms of the license. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the influence of Unix in academic circles led to large-scale adoption of Unix (BSD and System V) by commercial startups, including Sequent, HP-UX, Solaris, AIX, and Xenix. In the late 1980s, AT&T Unix System Laboratories and Sun Microsystems developed System V Release 4 (SVR4), which was subsequently adopted by many commercial Unix vendors. In the 1990s, Unix and Unix-like systems grew in popularity as BSD and Linux distributions were developed through collaboration by a worldwide network of programmers. In 2000, Apple released Darwin, also a Unix system, which became the core of the Mac OS X operating system, which was later renamed macOS. How about Linux? Linux is a family of free and open-source software operating systems built around the Linux kernel. Typically, Linux is packaged in a form known as a Linux distribution (or distro for short) for both desktop and server use. The defining component of a Linux distribution is the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. In 1991, while attending the University of Helsinki, Torvalds became curious about operating systems. Frustrated by the licensing of MINIX, which at the time limited it to educational use only, he began to work on his own operating system kernel, which eventually became the Linux kernel. Torvalds began the development of the Linux kernel on MINIX and applications written for MINIX were also used on Linux. Later, Linux matured and further Linux kernel development took place on Linux systems. GNU applications also replaced all MINIX components, because it was advantageous to use the freely available code from the GNU Project with the fledgling operating system; code licensed under the GNU GPL can be reused in other computer programs as long as they also are released under the same or a compatible license. Torvalds initiated a switch from his original license, which prohibited commercial redistribution, to the GNU GPL. Developers worked to integrate GNU components with the Linux kernel, making a fully functional and free operating system. Linus Torvalds had wanted to call his invention Freax, a portmanteau of free, freak, and x (as an allusion to Unix). During the start of his work on the system, some of the project's makefiles included the name Freax for about half a year. Torvalds had already considered the name Linux, but initially dismissed it as too egotistical. In order to facilitate development, the files were uploaded to the FTP server (ftp.funet.fi) of FUNET in September 1991. Ari Lemmke, Torvalds' coworker at the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT), who was one of the volunteer administrators for the FTP server at the time, did not think that Freax was a good name. So, he named the project Linux on the server without consulting Torvalds. Later, however, Torvalds consented to Linux. Adoption of Linux in production environments, rather than being used only by hobbyists, started to take off first in the mid-1990s in the supercomputing community, where organizations such as NASA started to replace their increasingly expensive machines with clusters of inexpensive commodity computers running Linux. Commercial use began when Dell and IBM, followed by Hewlett-Packard, started offering Linux support to escape Microsoft's monopoly in the desktop operating system market. Today, Linux systems are used throughout computing, from embedded systems to virtually all supercomputers, and have secured a place in server installations such as the popular LAMP application stack. Use of Linux distributions in home and enterprise desktops has been growing. Linux distributions have also become popular in the netbook market, with many devices shipping with customized Linux distributions installed, and Google releasing their own Chrome OS designed for netbooks. Linux's greatest success in the consumer market is perhaps the mobile device market, with Android being one of the most dominant operating systems on smartphones and very popular on tablets and, more recently, on wearables. Linux gaming is also on the rise with Valve showing its support for Linux and rolling out its own gaming oriented Linux distribution. Linux distributions have also gained popularity with various local and national governments, such as the federal government of Brazil. Greg Kroah-Hartman is the lead maintainer for the Linux kernel and guides its development. Stallman heads the Free Software Foundation, which in turn supports the GNU components. Finally, individuals and corporations develop third-party non-GNU components. These third-party components comprise a vast body of work and may include both kernel modules and user applications and libraries. Linux vendors and communities combine and distribute the kernel, GNU components, and non-GNU components, with additional package management software in the form of Linux distributions. Brief description for our Kernel aka Aptivi Kernel The kernel is built from scratch, and the first public Simulator version was built at 23 February, 2018. Currently, the Simulator grabs hardware information via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) or files in Linux which provides every information for your hardware, including the processor, RAM, and hard drive. It provides a built-in shell named Unified Eofla SHell (UESH) that will later be a kernel initialization program as known as InitiaOE which runs UESH if run on multiuser and uesh-maint if run on maintenance mode. Currently, it has a debugging feature that debugs the kernel on what's going on and saves it to a file. The debugger is useful to track issues with the kernel.

    "title": "Output redirection | Kernel Simulator API - Aptivi",
    "keywords": "Output redirection How it works Output redirection allows you to pipe the output of a command that needs to be saved to a file so you can use it later. For example, if you wanted to save an output for ls -l command in Linux, you would type it like this: ls -l > file.txt . In Unix systems, not only it allows you to redirect an output of a command to a file, but it also allows you to redirect it to a device like COM1, COM2, and so on. For example, there is a /dev blob that allows you to play sound just by piping the contents of a sound file to the device, and can be done in the root user like this: cat sound.wav > /dev/dsp . It can be done if the Linux kernel supports that device blob. In Kernel Simulator Currently, you can pipe the output of the command to a file like this: list >>>list.txt . It only supports Console.Out , so it doesn't work when piping an output coming from Console.Err . Caution You can't use this on some of the commands that require user interaction or commands that never generate output. If you did it to an interactive command like mail , ftp , and so on, you may find that it requires an input, though the fields don't print to the console, causing you to go to the file that holds console output, read the required field, and write the answer down. It gets even worse when the command lets you enter a separate shell for its functions like edit , ftp , mail , and so on. Here are two ways to pipe the output of a command to the file: Syntax Description >> It overwrites the output file and stores the output of the command to it >>> It appends the output to the output file"

    "keywords": "Studying Payslip virus The May 2019 Payslip virus, and its usage of some of KS's features On May 17, 2019, there was a new virus compiled using VB.NET, called Payslip, that manages to obtain some of KS's features, like the flagging system, TextWriterColor , etc. on its source code to avoid detection. Most of you have found viruses on shady sites, so you need to avoid these kinds of sites. We are here to study its disassembly of Payslip. According to ILDASM.EXE , there are about 6 namespaces, called Flags , Kernel , KernelTools , TextWriterColor , Translate , and xGd . As you can see below, there are 24 flags. So, it's based on an older version of KS. The rest of the pictures are for remaining namespaces and what's inside: Now, let's use JetBrains' dotPeek for further analysis. When we went to Flags , we saw all of the usual flags. Good. However, all of the subs on the Kernel namespace are not found, except these properties: public static string KernelVersion = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Version.ToString(); public static string[] BootArgs; public static string[] AvailableArgs; public static string[] availableCMDLineArgs; public static string MOTDMessage; public static string HName; public static string MAL; public static string EnvironmentOSType; static Kernel() // Generated by JetBrains dotPeek { string[] strArray1 = new string[Convert.ToInt32(3.41886116991581 + Math.Sqrt(2.5))]; strArray1[0] = \"quiet\"; strArray1[1] = \"cmdinject\"; label_1: int num1 = 322610553; string[] strArray2; while (true) { uint num2; switch ((num2 = (uint) (num1 ^ 1915212704)) % 9U) { case 0: num1 = (int) num2 * -685199074 ^ 818517677; continue; case 1: strArray1[Convert.ToInt32(5.41421356237309 - Math.Sqrt(2.0))] = \"help\"; Kernel.AvailableArgs = strArray1; num1 = (int) num2 * -85093751 ^ -1759328859; continue; case 2: goto label_3; case 3: strArray2[0] = \"createConf\"; strArray2[1] = \"promptArgs\"; num1 = (int) num2 * 1980815017 ^ -1632831499; continue; case 4: Kernel.EnvironmentOSType = Environment.OSVersion.ToString(); num1 = (int) num2 * -1749997108 ^ -1153977823; continue; case 5: strArray2 = new string[Convert.ToInt32(2.0 * 1.5)]; num1 = (int) num2 * 330882450 ^ 1511576150; continue; case 6: goto label_1; case 7: strArray2[Convert.ToInt32(3.0 - Math.Ceiling(1.0))] = \"testMod\"; Kernel.availableCMDLineArgs = strArray2; num1 = (int) num2 * 1472650476 ^ 1747686761; continue; case 8: strArray1[Convert.ToInt32(3.0 - Math.Sqrt(1.0))] = \"debug\"; strArray1[Convert.ToInt32(5.0 - Math.Round(1.5))] = \"maintenance\"; num1 = (int) num2 * -1989761204 ^ -1809828870; continue; default: goto label_11; } } label_3: return; label_11:; } Not good. In the KernelTools , 7 subs and 1 property are found. They represent the full version of these subs in an older version of KS. And now, let's go to writers. public static void Wdbg(string text, params object[] vars) { int num = Flags.DebugMode ? 1 : 0; } public static void W(object text, string colorType, params object[] vars) { } public static void Wln(object text, string colorType, params object[] vars) { } It seems that W() and Wln() writing subs are emptied, where the Wdbg() is filled with the check for debugging mode and set the result to the num variable. Nothing else. The last namespace we're looking at is Translate . We have 2 subs and 3 fields. The current language is eng , and the languages for the virus version are chi , eng , fre , ger , ind , ptg , and spa .

    "title": "Compatibility notes for second-gen KS | Kernel Simulator API - Aptivi",
    "keywords": "Compatibility notes for second-gen KS The second-generation versions of Kernel Simulator are not backwards-compatible with the first-generation versions, due to too many structural changes as outlined below. Here are the breaking changes per generation. Breaking API changes (Second-generation, Revision 0) Each breaking change have their own workarounds and description, including the reason why we've removed the API function. You need to provide alternatives for the below deprecated functions or APIs in your mods. 0.0.20.0 notes Warning When upgrading your mods to support 0.0.20.0, you must follow the compatibility notes to ensure that your mod works with 0.0.20.0. If you want to support the first-generation KS, you must separate your mod codebase to two parts: one for the first-gen and the other for the second-gen. They can't coexist with each other in your KSMods directory. Unified help system to support every shell We have unified the help system to support every shell provided in KS. This results in us having to do these changes: Affected functions: Removed TextEdit_GetHelp() Removed ZipShell_GetHelp() Removed FTPShowHelp() Removed IMAPShowHelp() Removed RSSShowHelp() Removed SFTPShowHelp() Removed TestShowHelp() Removed RDebugShowHelp() Changed constructor of CommandInfo to allow help usage writing Improved naming of injected commands During the re-write of kernel argument parser, we've done these changes: Affected variables: Replaced argcommands and argcmds() with InjectedCommands() in public API Prefixed the FTP shell variables with \"Ftp\" We needed to reduce the ambiguity of the FTP shell variables to minimize the risk of bugs, so we have prefixed these variables: Affected variables: connected -> FtpConnected initialized -> FtpInitialized currDirect -> FtpCurrentDirectory currentremoteDir -> FtpCurrentRemoteDir user -> FtpUser pass -> FtpPass strcmd -> FtpCommand Relocated Client(S)FTP to their Shell.vb files Affected variables: Moved ClientSFTP from SFTPGetCommand.vb to SFTPShell.vb Moved ClientFTP from FTPGetCommand.vb to FTPShell.vb Reworked on how to create notifications Affected variables: NotifyCreate() made obsolete Notification class moved to its individual file Made getting kernel paths more secure paths() used to store all the kernel paths, but it was implemented insecurely, so we decided to replace it with something more secure. Affected variables: paths() replaced with GetKernelPath and GetOtherPath Debug now uses the DebugLevel enumerator We no longer use Chars to indicate the debug level. Instead, we provide the DebugLevel enumerator to accurately represent debug levels that are available. Affected functions: Wdbg(), WdbgConditional(), and WdbgDevicesOnly() now take a DebugLevel enum value instead of char Rewritten command handler As we're moving to the second generation, many API changes needed to be done, so we've rewritten the command parser to divide the command codes into their separate code files. Affected functions: ExecuteCommand() from FTPGetCommand has been removed ExecuteCommand() from SFTPGetCommand has been removed Affected variables: CommandBase has been implemented. Just pass null to it from now in mods. Moved *CommandThread thread vars to ShellStartThreads . Consider publicizing it later. Moved IsOn* to PlatformDetector This is a breaking change for platform detection functions. We've moved them to PlatformDetector. Split ICustomSaver to separate codefile You can now reference the ICustomSaver within the KS namespace. Renamed variables in public API This renames some of the variables to something more meaningful, and, optionally, honors the Camel-Case standards. Affected variables: defSaverName -> DefSaverName CSvrdb -> CustomSavers finalSaver -> FinalSaver ScrnSvrdb -> Screensavers colorTemplates -> ColorTemplates setRootPasswd -> SetRootPassword RootPasswd -> RootPassword maintenance -> Maintenance argsOnBoot -> ArgsOnBoot clsOnLogin -> ClearOnLogin showMOTD -> ShowMOTD simHelp -> SimHelp slotProbe -> SlotProbe CornerTD -> CornerTimeDate instanceChecked -> InstanceChecked HName -> HostName currentLang -> CurrentLanguage dbgWriter -> DebugWriter dbgStackTraces -> DebugStackTraces ftpsite -> FtpSite ftpexit -> FtpExit dbgConns -> DebugConnections sftpsite -> SFTPSite sftpexit -> SFTPExit DRetries -> DownloadRetries URetries -> UploadRetries modcmnds -> ModCommands Made some cleanups regarding MOTD parser As part of the clean-up process, we've removed MOTDStreamR and MOTDStreamW as accidental public API variables. Affected variables: Removed MOTDStreamR Removed MOTDStreamW Renamed ReadMOTDFromFile to ReadMOTD Split GetConnectionInfo This splits GetConnectionInfo into two separate functions: New functions: GetConnectionInfo (added AuthMethods argument) PromptConnectionInfo This renames GetConnectionInfo to PromptConnectionInfo. Changed how mail listing works Using StringBuilder to make lists in MailListMessages is disgusting enough to warrant a change. Changed how reading contents API works Moved the original logic to PrintContents(), causing ReadContents() to consist of a function with the return type of String() that contains the file contents. Affected functions: ReadContents() New functions: PrintContents() + two overloads Removed NotifyCreate() The removal of NotifyCreate() is needed because it mimics the constructor, which is unnecessary. We've already made the constructor of the Notification class, and we thought that it's necessary to remove NotifyCreate(). Affected functions: NotifyCreate() Split the theme-related tools from ColorTools Affected functions: ApplyThemeFromResources ApplyThemeFromFile SetColors (theme overload) -> SetColorsTheme ColorTemplates -> Themes Implemented help helpers for commands and args We saw that providing hard-coded extra help wasn't a good idea, so why not make \"help helpers\" and get rid of hardcoded and irrelevant varibles once and for all? But, the \"help helpers\" aren't on their appropriate interfaces, because, on CommandInfo and ArgumentInfo, the default was null. Affected classes: ArgumentInfo CommandInfo Enumerized the reasons for the three events This makes it easier to distinguish the reasons. It has been set accordingly so that they could be combined. Affected events: LoginError ThemeSetError ColorSetError Split the custom screensaver code All the functions and variables which define the custom screensaver code are affected by this change. Compiler-related functions are moved to CustomSaverCompiler, while the tools are moved to CustomSaverTools. Moved few variables regarding mods This is to split a few variables from ModParser. Affected variables: All mod definitions, like ModDefs, TestModDefs, and so on are moved to HelpSystem. Scripts dictionary has been moved to ModManager IScript moved from ModParser to its individual file Renamed ScreensaverInfo for relevancy This name was misleading as it only has Screensaver, so you may think that it was a class meant for normal screensavers when it's really for custom screensavers. It's been renamed to CustomSaverInfo. Cleaned some flags up We see that making StopPanicAndGoToDoublePanic and InstanceChecked flags exposed to the public API (mods) is meaningless, so we've demoted these two to KernelTools as a friend. Implemented HelpUsages() to replace HelpUsage This gives a better support for commands with multiple usages. Unified the overloads for writing functions Reasons It has been recently reported that a single-lettered function or sub is not a good way to describe writing your text into the console or even doing anything. For example, if you're going to make a function that adds the two numbers from the two variables and returns the result, you're not going to name that function \"A,\" because, while it provides the shortcut to this function, it also creates problems, especially if you no longer understood what that function did or even meant for. The problem grows even worse when you decided to leave that function undocumented because you would like \"to be the only person that can understand it and nobody else.\" It also may pose confusions, because what if \"A\" is meant by \"AllNumbers,\" \"AddNumbers,\" \"AddTwoNumbers,\" or, obviously, \"Addition?\" Moreover, there was a need to overload all the writing functions by renaming their names to their appropriate \"Write\" functions so that we wouldn't have to use the separate functions for their colored versions. However, if it was bound to cause problems in later commits, we'll revert this change. Warning Your mods might break if any of them uses the console writing functions from KS, so change all the W() instances to Write() and remove any \"C\" or \"C16\" suffixes. Warning When writing such functions, you'll discover that the arguments parsing is stricter than the previous, due to how we've implemented the message argument. Make explicit casts while we're testing the new overloads to make sure that everything is the same as before. Actually removed AliasType It's basically a carbon-copy of ShellCommandType Reworked on the fetch kernel update API Affected functions: FetchKernelUpdates() has its return value changed to its dedicated class, KernelUpdate Removed the RGB class The RGB class was obsolete because the Color class does its job properly. Removed unnecessary OtherPath and its Get function This kind of path was unnecessary. Reworked on how to use the Color class All of the kernel color variables will now use the Color type instead of a string. This ensures easier usage of such variables. However, things will break if your mods still use the old traditional way of how to use such variables. Increased security of the \"scripts\" variable We have made the above variable private so that no mod can modify it for malicious purposes. [G|S]etConfig* functions and subs are now obsolete They are just derivatives of the already existing SetValue, GetValue, and GetPropertyValueInVariable with slight changes. Trying to avoid code repeats by warning. This will give mod devs a chance to move to the FieldManager versions before being removed in early cycles of RC2. Made IShell and shell stacks to handle shells This removes all kinds of InitializeShell() in all the shell common files to reduce confusion. Adjustments will be made to finish the implementation. Cleaned up GetLine() so strcommand is first It feels that ArgsMode was only used for one purpose, and it felt so unnecessary that it shouldn't have been implemented in the first place. Renamed ShellCommandType to ShellType It was used for many purposes other than the commands. Moved all the GetLine()'s for shells to the master GetLine() This removes all the GetLine specially crafted for the shells, because they're just repeated code taken from the master GetLine(). Moved GetTerminalEmulator() to ConsoleExtensions It's now part of the console extensions module, because it doesn't change how the kernel works. Split the exceptions to separate codefiles This will break mods that handle any kernel exceptions. They're now located in the Kernel.Exceptions namespace. However, this required a change to the Kernel class that involves namespacing it from KS.Kernel to KS.Kernel.Kernel. Renamed newline field to NewLine from vbNewLine Because vbNewLine sounded like it came from Visual Basic 6.0 (not .NET), a COM-based Windows-only language which we'll never support, and because of the below namespace changes that causes Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace to break things related to vbNewLine, we decided to change it to just NewLine . Namespaced the entire codebase To further organize the codebase, we decided to namespace each one of them based on the folders in the source code. This way, we'll have the following namespaces: Namespaces created: KS.Arguments KS.Arguments.ArgumentBase KS.Arguments.CommandLineArguments KS.Arguments.KernelArguments KS.Arguments.PreBootCommandLineArguments KS.ConsoleBase KS.ConsoleBase.Themes KS.ConsoleBase.Themes.Studio KS.Files KS.Hardware KS.Kernel KS.Kernel.Exceptions KS.Languages KS.Login KS.ManPages KS.Misc KS.Misc.Beautifiers KS.Misc.Calendar KS.Misc.Calendar.Events KS.Misc.Calendar.Reminders KS.Misc.Configuration KS.Misc.Encryption KS.Misc.Execution KS.Misc.Forecast KS.Misc.Games KS.Misc.JsonShell KS.Misc.JsonShell.Commands KS.Misc.Notifiers KS.Misc.Platform KS.Misc.Probers KS.Misc.Reflection KS.Misc.Screensaver KS.Misc.Screensaver.Customized KS.Misc.Screensaver.Displays KS.Misc.Splash KS.Misc.Splash.Splashes KS.Misc.TextEdit KS.Misc.TextEdit.Commands KS.Misc.Threading KS.Misc.Timers KS.Misc.Writers KS.Misc.Writers.ConsoleWriters KS.Misc.Writers.DebugWriters KS.Misc.Writers.FancyWriters KS.Misc.Writers.FancyWriters.Tools KS.Misc.Writers.MiscWriters KS.Misc.ZipFile KS.Misc.ZipFile.Commands KS.Modifications KS.Network KS.Network.FTP KS.Network.FTP.Commands KS.Network.FTP.Filesystem KS.Network.FTP.Transfer KS.Network.HTTP KS.Network.HTTP.Commands KS.Network.Mail KS.Network.Mail.Commands KS.Network.Mail.Directory KS.Network.Mail.PGP KS.Network.Mail.Transfer KS.Network.RemoteDebug KS.Network.RemoteDebug.Commands KS.Network.RemoteDebug.Interface KS.Network.RPC KS.Network.RSS KS.Network.RSS.Commands KS.Network.RSS.Instance KS.Network.SFTP KS.Network.SFTP.Commands KS.Network.SFTP.Filesystem KS.Network.SFTP.Transfer KS.Network.SSH KS.Scripting KS.Scripting.Interaction KS.Shell KS.Shell.Commands KS.Shell.ShellBase KS.Shell.Shells KS.TestShell KS.TestShell.Commands KS.TimeDate Help helpers are now part of the command interface We see that it's sometimes easy to make mistakes when trying to define the extra help action, so we decided to remove an optional argument from CommandInfo and move the helper sub to the command interface. Affected interfaces: ICommand Affected classes: CommandExecutor Removed built-in string evaluators For a variety of reasons: It was already done in Extensification, which will be moved to Extensification.Legacy soon They're insecure and slow, especially the normal Evaluate() function Affected classes: StringEvaluators Affected functions: Evaluate() EvaluateFast() Technical information These are the technical information about some of the above breaking changes: TextEdit_GetHelp() Name: TextEdit_GetHelp() Source file: TextEditHelpSystem.vb Version range: 0.0.11 - 0.0.20 Reason for deletion: Unifying the help systems Likeliness to come back: Highly unlikely ZipShell_GetHelp() Name: ZipShell_GetHelp() Source file: ZipHelpSystem.vb Version range: 0.0.16 - 0.0.20 Reason for deletion: Unifying the help systems Likeliness to come back: Highly unlikely FTPShowHelp() Name: FTPShowHelp() Source file: FTPHelpSystem.vb Version range: 0.0.5.5 - 0.0.20 Reason for deletion: Unifying the help systems Likeliness to come back: Highly unlikely IMAPShowHelp() Name: IMAPShowHelp() Source file: MailHelpSystem.vb Version range: 0.0.11 - 0.0.20 Reason for deletion: Unifying the help systems Likeliness to come back: Highly unlikely RSSShowHelp() Name: RSSShowHelp() Source file: RSSHelpSystem.vb Version range: 0.0.16 - 0.0.20 Reason for deletion: Unifying the help systems Likeliness to come back: Highly unlikely SFTPShowHelp() Name: SFTPShowHelp() Source file: SFTPHelpSystem.vb Version range: 0.0.13 - 0.0.20 Reason for deletion: Unifying the help systems Likeliness to come back: Highly unlikely TestShowHelp() Name: TestShowHelp() Source file: TestHelpSystem.vb Version range: 0.0.16 - 0.0.20 Reason for deletion: Unifying the help systems Likeliness to come back: Highly unlikely RDebugShowHelp() Name: RDebugShowHelp() Source file: RemoteDebugHelpSystem.vb Version range: 0.0.16 - 0.0.20 Reason for deletion: Unifying the help systems Likeliness to come back: Highly unlikely ExecuteCommand() Name: ExecuteCommand() Source file: FTPGetCommand.vb Version range: 0.0.5.5 - 0.0.20 Reason for deletion: Rewritten the command handler Likeliness to come back: Highly unlikely ExecuteCommand() Name: ExecuteCommand() Source file: SFTPGetCommand.vb Version range: 0.0.13 - 0.0.20 Reason for deletion: Rewritten the command handler Likeliness to come back: Highly unlikely NotifyCreate() Name: NotifyCreate() Source file: Notifications.vb Version range: 0.0.15 - 0.0.20 Reason for deletion: Mimicking the constructor Likeliness to come back: Highly unlikely 0.0.21.0 notes Warning When upgrading your mods to support 0.0.21.0, you must follow the compatibility notes to ensure that your mod works with 0.0.21.0. If you want to support the first-generation KS, you must separate your mod codebase to two parts: one for the first-gen and the other for the second-gen. They can't coexist with each other in your KSMods directory. Consolidated the obsolete functions The three deprecated functions are just wrappers to the reflection routines in Kernel Simulator. The one sub is about finding settings, but since we already have FindSetting(String, JToken) , why don't we just go ahead and remove the FindSetting(String, Boolean) one, since it doesn't support splashes? Affected functions: FindSetting(String, Boolean) SetConfigValueField() GetConfigValueField() GetConfigPropertyValueInVariableField() Technical information These are the technical information about some of the above breaking changes: FindSetting(String, Boolean) Name: FindSetting(String, Boolean) Source file: SettingsApp.vb Version range: 0.0.11 - 0.0.21 Reason for deletion: We already have FindSetting(String, JToken) Likeliness to come back: Highly unlikely SetConfigValueField() Name: SetConfigValueField() Source file: SettingsApp.vb Version range: 0.0.16 - 0.0.21 Reason for deletion: A wrapper function to reflection routine Likeliness to come back: Highly unlikely GetConfigValueField() Name: GetConfigValueField() Source file: SettingsApp.vb Version range: 0.0.16 - 0.0.21 Reason for deletion: A wrapper function to reflection routine Likeliness to come back: Highly unlikely GetConfigPropertyValueInVariableField() Name: GetConfigPropertyValueInVariableField() Source file: SettingsApp.vb Version range: 0.0.20 - 0.0.21 Reason for deletion: A wrapper function to reflection routine Likeliness to come back: Highly unlikely 0.0.22.0 notes Warning When upgrading your mods to support 0.0.22.0, you must follow the compatibility notes to ensure that your mod works with 0.0.22.0. If you want to support the first-generation KS, you must separate your mod codebase to two parts: one for the first-gen and the other for the second-gen.

Separated properties code to PropertyManager As we feel that properties reflection code should have their own place, we moved it to PropertyManager module. Affected functions: GetPropertyValueInVariable() GetProperties() GetPropertiesNoEvaluation() Events and reminders format As BinarySerializer is being deprecated, we've changed the format to the XML format. They're not compatible with the 0.0.21.0 and 0.0.20.0's event format. Deprecation of IScript.PerformCmd() As we have implemented the fully-fledged CommandBase.Execute() function which does the same thing as IScript.PerformCmd() , we'll deprecate the function in the interface to take advantage of the CommandBase.Execute() routine. If possible, upgrade your mods to use this routine instead of IScript.PerformCmd() , which will be deleted in the next API revision. Removed ReadLineLong() As ReadLine.Reboot supports long inputs, we've decided to remove the function, ReadLineLong() , as it doesn't do anything. Affected functions: ReadLineLong() Technical information These are the technical information about some of the above breaking changes: ReadLineLong() Name: ReadLineLong() Source file: Input.vb Version range: TBA - 0.0.22 Reason for deletion: We already have ReadLine.Reboot Likeliness to come back: Highly unlikely 0.0.23.0 notes Warning When upgrading your mods to support 0.0.23.0, you must follow the compatibility notes to ensure that your mod works with 0.0.23.0. If you want to support the first-generation KS, you must separate your mod codebase to two parts: one for the first-gen and the other for the second-gen. They can't coexist with each other in your KSMods directory. Deprecation of ICustomSaver As we've implemented BaseScreensaver to better handle screensavers, we decided to deprecate ICustomSaver in favor of the new screensaver model. This will merge all kernel threads of individual screensavers to one master screensaver thread. Breaking API changes (Second-generation, Revision 1) 0.0.24.0 notes Warning When upgrading your mods to support 0.0.24.0, you must follow the compatibility notes to ensure that your mod works with 0.0.24.0. If you want to support the first-generation KS, you must separate your mod codebase to two parts: one for the first-gen and the other for the second-gen. They can't coexist with each other in your KSMods directory. Removed support for ICustomSaver ICustomSaver is now replaced by the newer IScreensaver, effectively breaking all screensavers that use the old ICustomSaver interface. All guides for custom screensavers should be updated to reflect this change. If any of the screensavers that we've made in the guide still uses the old interface, raise an issue. To finalize this change, we've also renamed the module name of the screensaver parser from CustomSaverCompiler to CustomSaverParser. Affected functions: CompileCustom() -> ParseCustomSaver() Removed support for PerformCmd() PerformCmd() in IScript is now removed in favor of the changes during the development of 0.0.22.0. Affected functions: PerformCmd() Restructured the filesystem API Filesystem module was a god class , so we decided to consolidate it to their own separate files to accomodate with the upcoming changes. However, you need to use their own namespace (for example, if you want to copy a file, import KS.Files.Operations ) to be able to use them. We have also removed SetSizeParseMode() as it's redundant and it was there for compatibility reasons. You have more than enough APIs to do the same thing this function does, don't you? Note The base Filesystem module will stay so that path neutralization and invalid path detection routines will still be available under the same namespace in 0.0.24.0 and above. Removed functions: SetSizeParseMode() New namespaces: KS.Files.Attributes KS.Files.Folders KS.Files.LineEndings KS.Files.Operations KS.Files.PathLookup KS.Files.Print KS.Files.Querying KS.Files.Read Separated ConsoleColors enumeration It was previously inside the Colors255 module. Now, it resides in its own code file. It's in the same namespace. Removed KS.Misc.Dictionary to substitute with Dictify We have removed this namespace that existed in 0.0.23.0 to use the Dictify library so if we try to update it for bug fixes or feature additions, we don't depend on Kernel Simulator for this feature. Affected functions: GetWordInfo() Affected classes: DictionaryWord Moved network transfer APIs to its own namespace We have moved all network transfer APIs to KS.Network.Transfer to further organize the network APIs. Moved color-related console APIs to its own namespace We have moved all color-related console APIs to KS.ConsoleBase.Themes as it keeps getting expanded. Moved input-related console APIs to its own namespace We have moved all input-related console APIs to KS.ConsoleBase.Inputs as it keeps getting expanded. Removed the progress and its report positions from SplashInfo. The splashes are the ones who are responsible for setting their own progress positions. Removed properties: ProgressWritePositionX ProgressWritePositionY ProgressReportWritePositionX ProgressReportWritePositionY Replaced CommandPromptWrite() CommandPromptWrite() used to be the helper for UESH to write its own prompt, but it's eventually replaced by the more powerful WriteShellPrompt() to accommodate all possible cases, like custom variables, and so on. Organized the ShellBase namespaces The shell base has been divided to three types: Aliases Commands Shells Changed progress bar writer module name We didn't want to cause confusion between ProgressColor in the FancyWriters namespace and the actual ProgressColor in the ColorTools module, so we decided to extend the name of the progress bar writer module to ProgressBarColor . Affected modules ProgressColor -> ProgressBarColor"

    "keywords": "Breaking API changes (Third generation) 0.1.0 notes Warning When upgrading your mods to support 0.1.0, you must follow the compatibility notes to ensure that your mod works with 0.1.0. If you want to support both the first-generation and the second-generation KS, you must separate your mod codebase to three parts: one for the first-gen, the other for the second-gen, and the other for the third-gen. They can't coexist with each other in your KSMods directory. Moved events to KS.Kernel.Events All of the event-related code files are moved to KS.Kernel.Events to separate these from the actual kernel code. However, because events are part of the kernel, we prefer to put it on KS.Kernel namespace rather than KS.Misc . Moved PlatformDetector to KS.Kernel.KernelPlatform It has come to the conclusion that PlatformDetector is now promoted to the Kernel namespace under the name KernelPlatform so you can access it under the KS.Kernel namespace. Affected classes: PlatformDetector -> KernelPlatform Separated the MOTD and MAL parsers MOTD and MAL parsers were unified since early versions of Kernel Simulator. However, it didn't occur to us that we need to separate them for a very long time. Now is the time to separate them, effectively removing MessageType enumeration. Moved GetTerminal* to KernelPlatform These two functions are actually part of the terminal, and they make use of the $TERM_PROGRAM and $TERM environment variables, which are dependent on the terminal. Since these usually are undefined in Windows, we put these functions to KernelPlatform to accomodate the change as platform-dependent, but we don't actually check for Linux to execute these functions, because some terminal emulators in Windows actually define these variables. Moved shell common folders to KS.Shell.Shells This is to separate the shell code for each tool from their folders to a unified namespace, KS.Shell.Shells . It houses every shell for every tool. This is to make creation of built-in shells easier. This means that *ShellCommon modules are moved to KS.Shell.Shells.* and every call to that module should be redirected to that namespace. The tools, however, stays intact. Removed MakePermanent() This function is now removed as a result of recent configuration improvements. Graduated Configuration to KS.Kernel This configuration logic is smart enough to be graduated, since it's the core function in the kernel. It's used everywhere, including the settings command, which is an application that lets you adjust settings on the go. Graduated FindSetting and CheckSettingsVariables These two functions are probably unrelated to the settings app, but one of them is what KS.Misc.Settings.SettingsApp uses, and one of them is renamed to accomodate with the graduation. Renamed functions: CheckSettingsVariables() -> CheckConfigVariables() Moved power management functions to KS.Kernel.Power These power management functions were there in KernelTools since the earliest version of KS. Now, they're relocated to KS.Kernel.Power . Removed InitPaths in favor of properties Now, we don't have to initialize paths everytime we make an internal app that depends on Kernel Simulator's paths. The call to the function that gets the path, GetKernelPath , however won't be removed because it's widely used and is unaffected. This reduces the NullReferenceException bugs regarding paths. Moved kernel update code to Kernel.Updates Same story as in power management. Removed ListArgs() from ICommand and IArgument It seems that ListArgs() is now no longer a reliable way to check for arguments, as it could be null when no argument is provided. While it contains a collection of switches and arguments, it's sequential. We have separated between switches and arguments as demonstrated in both the ListArgsOnly() and ListSwitchesOnly() arrays. Moved GetEsc() to Misc.Text.CharManager GetEsc() is now widely used for color manipulation, but we need to move it to a better place as migration to ColorSeq is done. We have deleted Color255 from KS.ConsoleBase as a result of this migration."

    "title": "First-generation KS releases | Kernel Simulator API - Aptivi",
    "keywords": "First-generation KS releases KS 0.0.1.x series KS 0.0.1.0 (2/22/2018) In the release of 0.0.1.0, it originally included the prober and their codes are in the Kernel.vb code file, but that seemed irrelevant and messy. It also included the original log-in and shell, but it seems that on the booting procedure, it has generated the following output: (1) usrmgr: System Usernames: root useradd created. (2) usrmgr: User root has been successfully loaded. (3) usrmgr: User useradd has been successfully loaded. (4) usrmgr: demo not found. Creating... (5) usrmgr: Username demo created. (6) usrmgr: User root has been successfully loaded. (7) usrmgr: User useradd has been successfully loaded. (8) usrmgr: User demo has been successfully loaded. (9) usrmgr: User demo has been successfully loaded. On (1) , it told us that these administrators, root, and useradd (test account with admin rights), has been created but not yet initialized. On (2-3) , it told us that they have been loaded. On (4-5) , the test account has been created according to the manager and to the kernel. On (6-9) , the two admins have been loaded twice, like on (2-3) (bug), and on (8-9) , the test account loaded TWICE, not once. It's a bug. Also, it has made 2 unnecessary newlines between (9) and Welcome to Kernel! The Username: prompt is login: , meaning that it's difficult for users that haven't used Linux yet to understand what did \"login\" mean. However, the password: prompt is easy to understand for both the starters and experts. After you log-in, your prompt looks like this: [root@kernel] #: . The colon seems irrelevant. As soon as you enter \"help\", it will have a list of commands. However, it's uncolored. Some commands have their own aliases, and some commands report This kernel is not final. At almost every command executed, it looks like this: (1) (2) Output (3) Seems that in both (1) and (3) , these newlines are completely unnecessary. Also, the output of lsdrivers is somehow colored white when this version of kernel isn't supposed to have colors on outputs. It has these 2 screensavers, Disco, and BW Disco future-eyes-destroyer As soon as you run Disco, it will show the amazing disco effect, but it has a bug when you exit when the BG color is other than black that when you press ENTER, the BG color stays and prints the shell prompt then clears the BG color without clearing the screen, and when you type in commands, it has a black box around the written characters. Same thing as the output. When you reboot, everything will be fine. However, BW Disco will destroy your eyes (really) and has the same bug. Listing files has a fake output, although the kernel is not final. It lists boot, bin, dev, etc, lib, proc, usr, var and says \"Total number: 8 folders, 0 files.\" The directory set looks like the Linux dirset. You can't have arguments added to the command, or KS will assume that the command didn't exist although it exists, saying that for ex. you're trying to execute \"ls bin\", and it says that \"Shell message: The requested command ls bin is not found.\" Somehow, the message didn't have any unnecessary newline problem. In Login.vb , it contains many unnecessary variables. It has 5 variables for username and password, each being from different sources or declaration: Public usernamelist As New List(Of String) (Username list from Login.vb) Public passwordlist As New List(Of String) (Password list from Login.vb) Public userword As New Dictionary(Of String, String) (Dictionary stores Username and Password) My.Settings.Passwords (Password list from My.Settings) My.Settings.Usernames (Username list from My.Settings) Unnecessary variables. compared to the 0.0.3.0 version: Public userword As New Dictionary(Of String, String) (Dictionary stores Username and Password) KS 0.0.1.1 (3/16/2018) The changelogs at \"Documentation - main page.txt\" on src. code claim that it \"added \"showmotd\", changed a message and better checking for integer overflow on Beep Frequency.\" But which message? According to Meld (file comparison software), it says that the MOTD change done message is changed: Before: Done!\\nPlease log-out for the changes to take effect. After: Done!\\nPlease log-out, or use 'showmotd' to see the changes Sadly, this version has the same exact bugs as the first version. KS 0.0.2.x series KS 0.0.2.0 (3/31/2018) The changelogs said that its code is re-designed, has more commands, implemented basic Internet, argument system, changing password, and more changes. Although it has the same shutdown/restart delaying bug and the no newline after the shell message bug, here's how exactly the changes go: The \"login:\" prompt has changed to \"Username:\" for easier understanding There is a kernel argument system, and they're \"motd, nohwprobe, chkn=1, preadduser, hostname, and quiet.\" Let's see what do each argument do: motd: It tells you to write your message. (It worked) nohwprobe: It tells the kernel not to detect the hardware. (It worked) chkn=1: It checks for connectivity, but asks for address first. (It worked) preadduser: It adds user right on startup. (It worked) hostname: It changes your hostname temporarily. (It worked) quiet: It makes the kernel silent. (It worked) But there is a bug that when you try to execute arguments after rebooting the kernel which also has arguments executed, it will crash. Everything is colored now. Fixed unnecessary newlines between the output chpwd, hwprobe, lsnet, lsnettree, ping, showtd and sysinfo are added Fixed the disco background issue Everything that is mentioned in the changelog KS 0.0.2.1 (4/5/2018) The changelog says that it fixed a bug for \"Command Not Found\" message, and added forgotten checking for root in \"chhostname\" and \"chmotd\". There are no extra changes. KS 0.0.2.2 (4/9/2018) The changelog says that it fixed a bug for network list where double PC names show up on both listing ways, Error handling on listing networks. It also added an error handler for the kernel error. KS 0.0.2.3 (4/11/2018) The changelog says that it fixed crash on arguments after reboot, fix bugs, and more. What exactly is \"fix bugs, and more?\" Reason for crash: The simulator tried to initialize the time and date on each reboot. It has fixed newline issues when using frequency that is over 2048 Hz after answering question. Before: Are you sure that you want to beep at this frequency, 2049? (y/N) yBeep Time in seconds that has the limit of 1-3600: After: Are you sure that you want to beep at this frequency, 2049? (y/N) y\\nBeep Time in seconds that has the limit of 1-3600: It has fixed newline issues when answering the question wrong on choice command. Before: Do we have this bug? <Y/N> y[root@kernel] # After: Do we have this bug? <Y/N> y\\n[root@kernel] # KS 0.0.3.x series KS 0.0.3.0 (4/30/2018) The changelog says that it fixed bugs, Log-in system rewritten, added commands, added arguments, added permission system, custom colors, and more. This version allowed you to use colors of your choice. Let's be specific: Added the error handler when parsing arguments Added the gpuprobe argument (probes graphics card every startup) Added the check for network tools Added casting for showing time and date Added resetting variables function (was function, now sub) Added error handling when starting up kernel Please note that the error handling code blocks at this release is not the Try...Catch block, but the standard VB6 error handler code snippet below (On the Console application): On Error GoTo HandlerLabel Dim IntNumber As Integer = 50 / 0 Exit Sub :HandlerLabel Console.WriteLine(\"Divide by Zero\") Console.ReadKey KS 0.0.3.1 (5/2/2018) The changelog says that it has edited the shell title in preparation for 0.0.4.0, fix bugs with removing users, fix blank command, and added admin checking. The big release was scheduled to release in May 20, 2018, which is 3 days before the hard drive failed in such a horrible way. In anyway, in the exact form: In Login.vb, the management subs were moved into UserManagement.vb, leading to only these subs remaining: Sub LoginPrompt() Sub showPasswordPrompt(ByVal usernamerequested As String) Sub signIn(ByVal signedInUser As String) Added the \"(Admins Only)\" flag on chusrname, editperm, and rmuser Added the restricted command array Every command that starts with the space is considered as a comment Now default permissions is set everytime a user is created KS 0.0.4.x series KS 0.0.4.0 (5/20/2018) This is the big release of KS. The changelog say that it has changed of startup text, customizable settings, Themes, Command-line arguments, Command argument and full parsing, Actual directory system (alpha), more commands, calculator, debugging with stack trace, debugging logs (unfinished), no RAM leak, fix bugs, and more. In the exact form: Added command-line arguments and boot argument arguments Added debugging (Wdbg) Added the writing system (W and Wln) so that we will not use the loop of: System.Console.ForegroundColor = CType(inputColor, ConsoleColor) answerargs = System.Console.ReadLine() System.Console.ResetColor() Added the real command-line arguments (Running CMD on the KS root folder and running the executable file with arguments like \"KS.exe createConf\") createConf: Makes the kernel create the config file then exit promptArgs: Forces the kernel to prompt you for arguments Added themes Added error handler for setting permission Converted all error handlers to Try...Catch Added the option to show MOTD Added maintenance mode Added settings Added calculator No RAM leak Added setthemes, netinfo, calc, scical, unitconv, md, mkdir, rd, rmdir and debuglog commands Slowed down the time date change repeat rate from 100 ms to 500 ms Pinging target address can now be repeated Hardware probing is now extended Moved every sub that is in Kernel.vb to files that are appropriate It's really big! KS 0.0.4.1 (5/22/2018) The changelog says that it has fixed bugs in changing directory, fixed bugs in \"help chdir\", added alias for changing directory named \"cd\", and config update. But, how exactly? Before the HDD failure incident that lasted 5 days, this version was released as a quick backup release, called Failure Followup Release. We forgot to add the license header for Flags.vb Added the config upgrade system Added missing entry for \"cd\" Added the statement (And currDir = \"/\") Added the reloadconfig command (this command lets you reload config) Edited the help entry for changedir so it reflects \"cd\" Added the help entry for added command This was released in 5/22/2018, 1 day before the HDD failure in the development environment. KS 0.0.4.5 (7/15/2018) The changelog says that it has fixed bugs when any probers failed to probe hardware, added more details in probers, Help system improved, Fix bugs in color prompts, Prompts deprecated, and more, but also says that it has been delayed for 2 months due to the hard drive failure incident. Made changing MOTD and hostname permanent You can split when injecting commands using colons with spaces between them. Added maintenance mode argument Changed the tip for help argument Added error handler when setting colors No more bugs when any probers failed to get information about hardware Extended probers to contain more information Added async time/date on corner Changed the welcome banner Now the hardware probing error handling is more friendly Support for variables for Kernel Error Completely abandoned My.Settings MOTD and Hostname variables Added more temperature units Added config entries for Corner Time/Date, MOTD, and HostName Removed the BW Disco Prompts are deprecated Organized the help system We slowed down changing time/date from 500 ms to 1000 ms Removed unnecessary sub ShowTimeQuiet() KS 0.0.4.6 (7/16/2018) The changelog says that it has removed extraneous \"fed\" that stands as the removed command in 0.0.4.5 and preparation for 0.0.5's custom substitutions The custom substitutions preparation is exactly informing the user that the pre-defined aliases will be removed when running commands that has their own aliases, and when running the help command However the extraneous \"fed\" command is removed from the availableCommands() array. KS 0.0.4.7 (7/17/2018) The changelog says that it has better Error Handling for \"ping\" command and fixed \"unitconv\" usage message. Removed the message \"net: Network available.\" when chkn=1 is injected. Converted the rest of VB6 error handlers in Network.vb to Try...Catch blocks Ping attempts can now be repeated when there is an error The unitconv help message when the user didn't enter enough arguments is now updated to reflect the new units. KS 0.0.4.8 (4/30/2021) Removed panicsim Fixed time and date not showing on reboot Now help displays \"no help\" when command is not found Fixed help usage showing if the command and arguments are written KS 0.0.5.0 beta versions KS 0.0.4.9 (7/21/2018) The changelog says that it has better Error Handling for \"unitconv\" command, Added temporary aliases (not final because there is no \"showaliases\" command), fix some bugs, added time zones (\"showtdzone\", and show current time zone in \"showtd\"), Added \"alias\", \"chmal\", and \"showmal\", Made MOTD after login customizable, Allowed special characters on passwords to ensure security, Made Kernel Simulator single-instance to avoid interferences, and more. Multiple-instance check has been added using mutex to avoid interference with two or more KS processes that interfere with each other. Added the MOTD After Login Passwords can now have the symbols to ensure more security Fixed the error message that when removing users, it says \"Error trying to add username.\" Conversion of units are now case-insensitive Fixed unitconv showing results even if an error message appeared Better behavior when updating config You can manage aliases Changed the prompt removing message Changed from showing help as string to HelpSystem.ShowHelp(words(0)) Added alias, chmal, showmal and showtdzone commands Made the shell parse aliases Made the writer in the CMD prompt write sub one-line Added support for timezones KS 0.0.4.10 (8/1/2018) The changelog says that it has fused \"sysinfo\" with \"lsdrivers\", Improved Help definition (used dictionary for preparation for modding), added \"lscomp\" which can list all online and offline computers by names only, Added error handler for \"lsnet\" and \"lsnettree\", fixed grammatical mistakes in \"lsnet\" and \"lsnettree\", added mods (commands not implemented yet - <modname>.m ), added screensavers, changed the behavior of showing MOTD, fixed bug where instance checking after reboot of the kernel would say that it has more than one instance and should close, and more. Made every sub and every module public for modifications Added modification support Fixed the instance checking every reboot (The instanceChecked flag has been added) Made every if statement that is one-statement one-line Now MOTD will only be shown once Added screensavers Added support for listing all computers, even if they're offline Added VB6 error handler for lscomp, lsnet, and lsnettree Running Disco Effect now makes the cursor invisible, while if exiting, the background will be reset and the cursor will be visible. Reduced the number of times the code block below is run in GetCommand.vb: Dim words = requestedCommand.Split({\" \"c}) Dim c As Integer For arg = 1 To words.Count - 1 c = c + words(arg).Count + 1 Next Dim strArgs As String = requestedCommand.Substring(requestedCommand.IndexOf(\" \"), c) Dim args() As String = strArgs.Split({\" \"c}, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries) by moving it to the top with some modifications, resulting in: Dim index As Integer = requestedCommand.IndexOf(\" \") If (index = -1) Then index = requestedCommand.Length Dim words = requestedCommand.Split({\" \"c}) Dim strArgs As String = requestedCommand.Substring(index) If Not (index = requestedCommand.Length) Then strArgs = strArgs.Substring(1) Dim args() As String = strArgs.Split({\" \"c}, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries) Changed the redundant alias from beep to annoying-sound Added loadsaver, lockscreen, setsaver and savescreen commands Replaced lsdrivers with lscomp, and the output of lsdrivers is moved into sysinfo Now, ExecuteCommand() sub's error handler can say which command failed to execute. The help definitions are now converted into dictionary. This is also a preparation for translated kernels. Fixed the messy command listing in ShowHelp() ueshversion variable is removed because it isn't updated since 0.0.4, and the UESH version is now inherited from the version of the kernel KS 0.0.4.11 (8/3/2018) The changelog says that it has removed pre-defined aliases, and fixed known bug that is mentioned. Let's see what is our known bug that is lying around until 0.0.4.11. The troubleshooting documentation on the source code says that when setting \"Colored Shell\" to False, you will see that input color is white instead of gray. The root cause? On TextWriterColor.vb, on W() sub, the code looks like this (one-line, was three lines): If (colorType = \"input\") Then ForegroundColor = inputColor It didn't check if the ColoredShell variable was true, so it always tries to change the console foreground color to inputColor, even if the Colored Shell setting was set to false. Because this bug is fixed, the code now looks like this: If (colorType = \"input\" And ColoredShell = True) Then ForegroundColor = inputColor However, this change didn't happen on Wln() sub because all prompts use W() to properly initialize the prompts. Now, the exact changes: Changed the error handler for W() and Wln() subs from VB6 method to Try...Catch blocks Now, when the template is LinuxUncoloredDef, the colored shell variable gets set to False, because everything is uncolored in this template. Removed the pre-defined aliases for commands Edited the help definition so it says that the disco command will be removed and the effect will take place in screensavers. KS 0.0.4.12 (8/16/2018) The changelog only says \"Replaced disco command with a screensaver.\" KS 0.0.5.x series KS 0.0.5.0 (9/4/2018) The changelog says \"Removed prompts, fixed MAL username probing, added \"showaliases\", fixed alias parsing, removed the requirement to provide command to remove alias, and implementation of user-made commands in mods\" This release is the final 2 releases to be released without any library dependencies. Removed prompts for commands and arguments, resulting in the slight file-size reduction (0.0.4.12: 306KB -> 0.0.5: 292KB) Added 2 color variables for storing help command list and definitions Added Black to available colors Setting colors are now permanent Removed motd, chkn=1, preadduser and hostname arguments Now the kernel creates a demo test account only if the \"Create demo account\" setting is set to True Now the beep command prevents frequencies that is more than 2048 Hz Now mods can have commands, and can have the dictionary modlist The manageAlias() sub values are all required Added command showaliases, although there is no help definition for it Fixed the alias parser that when the command line contains one of the words in the alias list, the alias will get executed before the command. KS 0.0.5.1 (9/6/2018) The changelog says \"Follow-up release removed unused code, improved behavior of debugging logs, and improved readability of a debug message while probing mods with commands without definitions.\" Changed the startup banner again It parses real command-line arguments on startup Improved behavior of debugging logs Improved readability of a debug message while probing mods with commands without definitions. KS 0.0.5.2 (9/9/2018) The changelog says \"Made GPU probing on boot, removing \"gpuprobe\" argument, changed behavior of updating config\" Now, GPU will always be probed since hardware probing is important, resulting in a removal of the gpuprobe argument Removed the GPUProbeFlag variable Changed the behavior of updating config so double entry bug doesn't appear KS 0.0.5.5 (9/22/2018) This version now uses the MadMilkman.Ini library that you can view in useddeps command. The changelog said \"Re-written config, Forbidden aliases, added missing help entries for \"showaliases\", added more MOTD and MAL placeholders, fixed repeating message of RAM status, and an FTP client has been added, finally!\" This version is also the final version not to work properly under Unix systems. The shutdown and reboot command will no longer delay, but still makes beeping sound All of the config are re-written, using the new library, MadMilkman.Ini .NET 4.0 Probing status for hardware is now deprecated The repeating message of RAM status has been fixed. Added more MOTD and MAL placeholders, resulting in user, shortdate, longdate, shorttime, longtime, timezone and summertimezone placeholders being added Now when the integer overflow exception is thrown, the message is more descriptive.

Meanwhile, here's the basic guide on how to start the UESH scripting. How to make scripts? Create an empty text file, but make the extension .uesh Open it using any text editor Write any valid KS command. Make sure that you separate between commands using the newlines for readability. If you need to put comments, put a # in the beginning of each line. Save the file. Now, run KS, and write the file name with .uesh Your script should run. Scripting format Any normal command that you would normally execute in the shell of Kernel Simulator can be written in the file as if you're writing a command. It supports the arguments. It can be written like below: echo Hello World! However, if you need to comment on something, it should be written in the newline as in the below form: # A script that prints \"Hello World\" Also, every line that starts with the space or with the # is considered as a comment, and they will not be executed as commands."

It can even convert your configuration files from the first version that implemented it, which is 0.0.4. It comes with Kernel Simulator and does not need to be installed separately in order to be used. Your old configuration files will be backed up to KSBackups directory in your user profile directory so you can easily revert to a pre-1.3 API version of KS (0.0.15.x or lower). Conversion KSConverter can convert the following configurations: Kernel configuration Blocked devices list to be added to list of devices FTP speed dial Users Aliases ...from the configuration files that were previously made on earlier versions of KS in the following formats: File Version Result kernelConfig.ini 0.0.4.x -> 0.0.5.4 KernelConfig.json kernelConfig.ini 0.0.5.5 -> 0.0.15.x KernelConfig.json blocked_devices.csv 0.0.12.x -> 0.0.15.x DebugDeviceNames.json ftp_speeddial.csv 0.0.11.x -> 0.0.15.x FTP_SpeedDial.json users.csv 0.0.4 -> 0.0.15.x Users.json aliases.csv 0.0.6 -> 0.0.15.x Aliases.json Warning KSConverter for .NET 6.0 can't convert the configuration files from the old format to the new one.

    "title": "KSJsonifyLocales | Kernel Simulator API - Aptivi",
    "keywords": "KSJsonifyLocales KSJsonifyLocales is the new tool that can convert the language files consisting of translations of strings to a readable JSON format. It is to ensure that there are no misses in lines of one of the languages. How it works The normal flow KSJsonifyLocales contains the Translations folder that has the translation text files inside. When this program is run, it reads the entire folder, parses all the files, and converts them to the JSON output, which can be found in Translations/Done folder in the same place as the executable. If run with --CopyToResources , it will copy the results directly to Kernel Simulator's resources, assuming that it's run on KSBuild found inside the source code folder. This usually works with git clones of KS. To illustrate this, KSJsonifyLocales will: read the Translations folder, parse each language file, add them to the list of language files, read both the English and the target language lines, save them to JSON, and save them to Translations/Done or (optionally) ../../Resources, assuming that the executable is found one level above the Kernel Simulator source folder What else can it do? These switches can change the way how KSJsonifyLocales runs. In ordrer to use any of the switches, you must provide one of the first three switches so that the language parsing can be modified using the switches other than them. Refer to the table below for description: Switch Description --CustomOnly Parses the custom languages only. --NormalOnly Parses the normal languages only. --All Parses all the languages. --Singular Parses a single language only. --CopyToResources Copies the result to the resources folder of Kernel Simulator. Requires a copy of source code. Custom languages The CustomLanguages folder is for the custom languages which change the language of the messages found in Kernel Simulator. This folder can be used to store the text files of your custom languages, but you have to place the metadata information for each custom language to be read by the kernel as it starts up. It can be accessed in the same location as the Kernel Simulator executable. This metadata information should be stored in a file called Metadata.json in the format below to be jsonified by this tool. It should not be removed. \"lng\": { \"name\": \"Language\", \"transliterable\": false / true } Example: \"afr\": { \"name\": \"Afrikaans\", \"transliterable\": false } The outputs for the custom languages can be found in the KSLanguages folder in your system profile directory ( $HOME or %USERPROFILE% ) stored as lng.json. For example, afr.json. If there's a transliterable version of a language that you're going to add, you must implement two versions of the language: The translated version (lng-T, for e.g. arb-T) The transliterated version (lng, for e.g. arb) Warning The custom language shouldn't be under the same three-letter language name; it should be unique. If you're creating a fixed version of the existing language, you should append a number after it. For example, \"afr-1\", not \"afr\". How to use On Windows, you can just double-click on the KSJsonifyLocales.exe file. It's usually found on the same directory as Kernel Simulator. On Linux, you can run mono KSJsonifyLocales.exe"
