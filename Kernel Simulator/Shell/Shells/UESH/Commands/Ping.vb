    ''' Pings an address

    ''' <remarks>
    ''' This command was implemented when the basic network support was released in 0.0.2 using the old way of pinging. Eventually, it was removed in 0.0.7. It came back in 0.0.12 under a different implementation.
    ''' <br></br>
    ''' If you want to ping an address to see if it's offline or online, or if you want to see if you're online or offline, use this command.
