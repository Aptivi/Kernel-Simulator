|---------------+--> Kernel Simulator - Simulates the future kernel that is planned by us <--+---------------|

NOTE: This kernel simulator will continue to be developed, even if we made the real PC version of Kernel.
	  Are you building a Linux version of Kernel Simulator in MonoDevelop? If so, add in "kernel Simulator.vbproj":
	  <VbcToolExe>vbc</VbcToolExe>
	  <AutoGenerateBindingRedirects>true</AutoGenerateBindingRedirects>
	  <GenerateBindingRedirectsOutputType>true</GenerateBindingRedirectsOutputType>
	  and change the output path to your choice if you are building using Release.

INFO: This kernel simulator is not a final planned version of Kernel, since it was minimal.
	  It can only be Console at the moment, while we are developing a GUI for this simulator.

Kernel Simulator lets you simulate a very early access for our future Kernel. Cannot log-in to Kernel Simulator on "root" account? The password is the backwards of "root"
