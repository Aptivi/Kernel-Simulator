|---------------+--> Kernel Simulator - Simulates the future kernel that is planned by us <--+---------------|

INFO: Are you building a Linux version of Kernel Simulator in MonoDevelop? If so, install MonoDevelop and libmono-microsoft-visualbasic10.0-cil. While we suggest MonoDevelop, we recommend JetBrains Rider for Linux 64-bit.

INFO: This kernel simulator is not a final planned version of Kernel, since it was minimal.

INFO: Two documentations, faq and troubleshooting, are deleted because they are not updated regularly.

Kernel Simulator lets you simulate a very early access for our future Kernel that will continue to be developed, even if we made the real PC version of Kernel.
