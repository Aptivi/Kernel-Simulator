|---------------+--> Kernel Simulator - Simulates the future kernel that is planned by us <--+---------------|

NOTE: This kernel simulator will continue to be developed, even if we made the real PC version of Kernel.

INFO: This kernel simulator is not a final planned version of Kernel, since it was minimal.
	  It can only be Console at the moment, while we are developing a GUI for this simulator.

Kernel Simulator lets you simulate a very early access for our future Kernel. It provides the built-in hardware
detector, log-in manager, and the shell.

Cannot log-in to Kernel Simulator on "root" account? The password is the backwards of "root"
