- General

Q: Why is this kernel unfinished?
A: Because it is still on early alpha development stage. We are currently at 0.0.x stage. Stages:

	0.0.x indicates that it is alpha
	0.x.x indicates that it is beta
	0.99.x indicates that it is release candidate
	x.x.x indicates that it is final release

Q: Can this program have an editor?
A: Yes, you can make one, or if you don't know how to contribute, wait for someone else or the owner to contribute.

- Log-in

Q: Why when I log-in into random usernames that does not exist, on the debugger, it says that there is an error?
A: It is handled by supressing it. It is optional that you will see this error on the debugging window.

- Commands

Q: Why the "beep" does not produce beep sound?
A: The host system doesn't have the motherboard speaker, or the motherboard speaker isn't plugged in correctly, or it is malfunctioned.
   EDIT: Some PCs might make a "beep" on the internal sound speaker inside your PC. Dell Optiplex 7040 + Windows 10 is known to have it.

- FTP

Q: Why does the "Injecting CWD..." message appear?
A: Because we use .NET Framework 4.0 as our development framework and we have to make a workaround to force FTP to use CWD before doing
   transmissions. This does not indicate an error.
