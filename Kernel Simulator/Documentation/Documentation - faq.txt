- General

Q: Why do I get the kernel panic about not being able to get information about hardware?
A: You have either found a bug in the kernel, or you are running an unsupported version of Windows.
   EDIT: Kernel panics about hardware now is friendlier, and allows you to continue.

Q: Why is this kernel unfinished?

	x.99.x indicates that it is release candidate
	x.x.x indicates that it is final release

Q: Can this program have an editor?
A: Yes, you can make one, or if you don't know how to contribute, wait for someone else or the owner to contribute.


- Log-in

Q: Why when I log-in into random usernames that does not exist, on the debugger, it says that there is an error?
A: It is handled by supressing it. It is optional that you will see this error on the debugging window.

Q: I accidentally made a typo in my username while creating. Can I change it?
A: The name changing feature will be included in the future. From now, just create another username with your correct name in it.
   EDIT: You can change your name since 0.0.3.


- Commands

Q: I cannot execute a command with arguments. Is there something wrong?
A: The command system is incomplete, it does not support arguments.
   EDIT: The command system is now complete and supports arguments.

Q: Is it interactive?
A: Now, it is not interactive, Possibly, on the bootable version of Kernel, it will include the interactive shell.

Q: Why the "beep" or "annoying-sound" does not produce beep sound?
A: The host system doesn't have the motherboard speaker, or the motherboard speaker isn't plugged in correctly, or it is malfunctioned.
   EDIT: Some PCs might make a "beep" on the internal sound speaker inside your PC. Dell Optiplex 7040 + Windows 10 is known to have it.
