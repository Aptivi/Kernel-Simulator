You have set your system language to anything other than English. Sorry for the inconvenience, but it seems that Google and its translator are very weird about translating code blocks for any programming language. While we fix all the code blocks for translated manual pages, we suggest you open a ticket to Google Translate for translating code blocks that aren't meant to be translated, and set your system language to English if you speak it.
