# Splashes

## What are the splashes?

Splashes are another way to greet the users before the log-in. They act like a progress bar for any application initialization, including the kernel itself. They were inspired from the Plymouth project, a kernel splash screen for Linux systems.

You can turn them on or off by kernel configuration, but you must reboot the kernel in order for the changes to take effect.

## Can I create my own splash?

Yes! Consult the [Splash Guide](../development/Custom-splash-guide.md) for more information.
