# First-generation KS releases

## KS 0.0.1.x series

### KS 0.0.1.0 (2/22/2018)

In the release of 0.0.1.0, it originally included the prober and their codes are in the `Kernel.vb` code file, but that seemed irrelevant and messy. It also included the original log-in and shell, but it seems that on the booting procedure, it has generated the following output:

```
(1) usrmgr: System Usernames: root useradd created.
(2) usrmgr: User root has been successfully loaded.
(3) usrmgr: User useradd has been successfully loaded.
(4) usrmgr: demo not found. Creating...
(5) usrmgr: Username demo created.
(6) usrmgr: User root has been successfully loaded.
(7) usrmgr: User useradd has been successfully loaded.
(8) usrmgr: User demo has been successfully loaded.
(9) usrmgr: User demo has been successfully loaded.
```

On `(1)`, it told us that these administrators, root, and useradd (test account with admin rights), has been created but not yet initialized.

On `(2-3)`, it told us that they have been loaded.

On `(4-5)`, the test account has been created according to the manager and to the kernel.

On `(6-9)`, the two admins have been loaded twice, like on `(2-3)` (bug), and on `(8-9)`, the test account loaded TWICE, not once. It's a bug.

Also, it has made 2 unnecessary newlines between (9) and `Welcome to Kernel!`

The `Username:` prompt is `login:`, meaning that it's difficult for users that haven't used Linux yet to understand what did "login" mean. However, the `password:` prompt is easy to understand for both the starters and experts.

After you log-in, your prompt looks like this: `[root@kernel] #: `. The colon seems irrelevant.

As soon as you enter "help", it will have a list of commands. However, it's uncolored.

Some commands have their own aliases, and some commands report `This kernel is not final.` At almost every command executed, it looks like this:

```
(1) 
(2) Output
(3)
```

Seems that in both `(1)` and `(3)`, these newlines are completely unnecessary. Also, the output of `lsdrivers` is somehow colored white when this version of kernel isn't supposed to have colors on outputs.

It has these 2 screensavers, Disco, and BW Disco `future-eyes-destroyer`

As soon as you run Disco, it will show the amazing disco effect, but it has a bug when you exit when the BG color is other than black that when you press ENTER, the BG color stays and prints the shell prompt then clears the BG color without clearing the screen, and when you type in commands, it has a black box around the written characters. Same thing as the output. When you reboot, everything will be fine.

However, BW Disco will destroy your eyes (really) and has the same bug.

Listing files has a fake output, although the kernel is not final. It lists boot, bin, dev, etc, lib, proc, usr, var and says "Total number: 8 folders, 0 files." The directory set looks like the Linux dirset.

You can't have arguments added to the command, or KS will assume that the command didn't exist although it exists, saying that for ex. you're trying to execute "ls bin", and it says that "Shell message: The requested command ls bin is not found." Somehow, the message didn't have any unnecessary newline problem.

In `Login.vb`, it contains many unnecessary variables. It has 5 variables for username and password, each being from different sources or declaration:

```vb
Public usernamelist As New List(Of String)           (Username list from Login.vb)
Public passwordlist As New List(Of String)           (Password list from Login.vb)
Public userword As New Dictionary(Of String, String) (Dictionary stores Username and Password)
My.Settings.Passwords                                (Password list from My.Settings)
My.Settings.Usernames                                (Username list from My.Settings)
```

Unnecessary variables. compared to the 0.0.3.0 version:

```vb
Public userword As New Dictionary(Of String, String)         (Dictionary stores Username and Password)
```

### KS 0.0.1.1 (3/16/2018)

The changelogs at "Documentation - main page.txt" on src. code claim that it "added "showmotd", changed a message and better checking for integer overflow on Beep Frequency."

But which message? According to Meld (file comparison software), it says that the MOTD change done message is changed:

* Before: `Done!\nPlease log-out for the changes to take effect.`
* After: `Done!\nPlease log-out, or use 'showmotd' to see the changes`

Sadly, this version has the same exact bugs as the first version.

## KS 0.0.2.x series

### KS 0.0.2.0 (3/31/2018)

The changelogs said that its code is re-designed, has more commands, implemented basic Internet, argument system, changing password, and more changes.

Although it has the same shutdown/restart delaying bug and the no newline after the shell message bug, here's how exactly the changes go:

1. The "login:" prompt has changed to "Username:" for easier understanding
2. There is a kernel argument system, and they're "motd, nohwprobe, chkn=1, preadduser, hostname, and quiet." Let's see what do each argument do:
   * motd: It tells you to write your message. (It worked)
   * nohwprobe: It tells the kernel not to detect the hardware. (It worked)
   * chkn=1: It checks for connectivity, but asks for address first. (It worked)
   * preadduser: It adds user right on startup. (It worked)
   * hostname: It changes your hostname temporarily. (It worked)
   * quiet: It makes the kernel silent. (It worked)
   * But there is a bug that when you try to execute arguments after rebooting the kernel which also has arguments executed, it will crash.
3. Everything is colored now.
4. Fixed unnecessary newlines between the output
5. chpwd, hwprobe, lsnet, lsnettree, ping, showtd and sysinfo are added
6. Fixed the disco background issue
7. Everything that is mentioned in the changelog

### KS 0.0.2.1 (4/5/2018)

The changelog says that it fixed a bug for "Command Not Found" message, and added forgotten checking for root in "chhostname" and "chmotd".

There are no extra changes.

### KS 0.0.2.2 (4/9/2018)

The changelog says that it fixed a bug for network list where double PC names show up on both listing ways, Error handling on listing networks.

It also added an error handler for the kernel error.

### KS 0.0.2.3 (4/11/2018)

The changelog says that it fixed crash on arguments after reboot, fix bugs, and more. What exactly is "fix bugs, and more?"

Reason for crash: The simulator tried to initialize the time and date on each reboot.

1. It has fixed newline issues when using frequency that is over 2048 Hz after answering question.
   * Before: `Are you sure that you want to beep at this frequency, 2049? (y/N) yBeep Time in seconds that has the limit of 1-3600:`
   * After: `Are you sure that you want to beep at this frequency, 2049? (y/N) y\nBeep Time in seconds that has the limit of 1-3600:`
2. It has fixed newline issues when answering the question wrong on choice command. 
   * Before: `Do we have this bug? <Y/N> y[root@kernel] #`
   * After: `Do we have this bug? <Y/N> y\n[root@kernel] #`

## KS 0.0.3.x series

### KS 0.0.3.0 (4/30/2018)

The changelog says that it fixed bugs, Log-in system rewritten, added commands, added arguments, added permission system, custom colors, and more.

This version allowed you to use colors of your choice. Let's be specific:

1. Added the error handler when parsing arguments
2. Added the gpuprobe argument (probes graphics card every startup)
3. Added the check for network tools
4. Added casting for showing time and date
5. Added resetting variables function (was function, now sub)
6. Added error handling when starting up kernel

Please note that the error handling code blocks at this release is not the Try...Catch block, but the standard VB6 error handler code snippet below (On the Console application):

```vb
On Error GoTo HandlerLabel

Dim IntNumber As Integer = 50 / 0
Exit Sub

:HandlerLabel
Console.WriteLine("Divide by Zero")
Console.ReadKey
```

### KS 0.0.3.1 (5/2/2018)

The changelog says that it has edited the shell title in preparation for 0.0.4.0, fix bugs with removing users, fix blank command, and added admin checking. 

The big release was scheduled to release in May 20, 2018, which is 3 days before the hard drive failed in such a horrible way. 

In anyway, in the exact form:

1. In Login.vb, the management subs were moved into UserManagement.vb, leading to only these subs remaining:
   * `Sub LoginPrompt()`
   * `Sub showPasswordPrompt(ByVal usernamerequested As String)`
   * `Sub signIn(ByVal signedInUser As String)`
2. Added the "(Admins Only)" flag on chusrname, editperm, and rmuser

   answerargs = System.Console.ReadLine()
   System.TermExts.ResetColors()
   ```
4. Added the real command-line arguments (Running CMD on the KS root folder and running the executable file with arguments like "KS.exe createConf")

        c = c + words(arg).Count + 1
    Next
    Dim strArgs As String = requestedCommand.Substring(requestedCommand.IndexOf(" "), c)

16. Fixed the messy command listing in ShowHelp()
17. ueshversion variable is removed because it isn't updated since 0.0.4, and the UESH version is now inherited from the version of the kernel

### KS 0.0.4.11 (8/3/2018)

The changelog says that it has removed pre-defined aliases, and fixed known bug that is mentioned.

Let's see what is our known bug that is lying around until 0.0.4.11.

The troubleshooting documentation on the source code says that when setting "Colored Shell" to False, you will see that input color is white instead of gray.

The root cause? On TextWriterColor.vb, on W() sub, the code looks like this (one-line, was three lines):

```vb
If (colorType = "input") Then ForegroundColor = inputColor
```

It didn't check if the ColoredShell variable was true, so it always tries to change the console foreground color to inputColor, even if the Colored Shell setting was set to false.

Because this bug is fixed, the code now looks like this:

```vb
If (colorType = "input" And ColoredShell = True) Then ForegroundColor = inputColor
```

However, this change didn't happen on Wln() sub because all prompts use W() to properly initialize the prompts.

Now, the exact changes:

1. Changed the error handler for W() and Wln() subs from VB6 method to Try...Catch blocks
2. Now, when the template is LinuxUncoloredDef, the colored shell variable gets set to False, because everything is uncolored in this template.
3. Removed the pre-defined aliases for commands
4. Edited the help definition so it says that the disco command will be removed and the effect will take place in screensavers.

### KS 0.0.4.12 (8/16/2018)

The changelog only says "Replaced disco command with a screensaver."

## KS 0.0.5.x series

### KS 0.0.5.0 (9/4/2018)

This release is the final 2 releases to be released without any library dependencies.

1. Removed prompts for commands and arguments, resulting in the slight file-size reduction (0.0.4.12: 306KB -> 0.0.5: 292KB)
2. Added 2 color variables for storing help command list and definitions
3. Added Black to available colors
4. Setting colors are now permanent
5. Removed motd, chkn=1, preadduser and hostname arguments
6. Now the kernel creates a demo test account only if the "Create demo account" setting is set to True
7. Now the beep command prevents frequencies that is more than 2048 Hz
8. Now mods can have commands, and can have the dictionary modlist
9. The manageAlias() sub values are all required
10. Added command showaliases, although there is no help definition for it
