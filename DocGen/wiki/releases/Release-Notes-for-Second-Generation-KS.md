# Second-generation KS releases

Because the API was having mixed code of between refactored and unrefactored, we would like to release the second-generation Kernel Simulator to celebrate the end of Alpha stage of this kernel, as well as the new "beta" version of our kernel.

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that the API that the second-generation KS has will not be backwards-compatible with the first-generation API, so we urge all mod and screensaver developers to update their mod to fully support second-generation and optionally provide the first-generation version, following the [Compatibility Notes for Second Generation KS](Compatibility-Notes-for-Second-Generation-KS.md). Meanwhile, we plan to keep supporting the first generation KS until 2024.
