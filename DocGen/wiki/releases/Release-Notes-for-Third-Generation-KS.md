# Third-generation KS releases

We have outlined in our old product documentation that `0.1.x` is real beta, so we'll promote it to this version.

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that the API that the third-generation KS has will not be backwards-compatible with the second-generation and the first-generation APIs, so we urge all mod and screensaver developers to update their mod to fully support third-generation and optionally provide the second-generation and the first-generation version, following the [Compatibility Notes for Third Generation KS](Compatibility-Notes-for-Third-Generation-KS.md). Meanwhile, we plan to keep supporting the first generation KS until 2024 and the second generation until 2027.
