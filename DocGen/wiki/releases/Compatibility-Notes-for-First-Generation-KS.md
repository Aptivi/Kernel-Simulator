## Compatibility notes for first-gen KS

The first-generation versions of Kernel Simulator are not compatible with the second-generation versions, due to too many structural changes. Here are the breaking changes per generation.

During the lifecycle of Kernel Simulator, new versions tend to appear frequently. This causes some of the functions and APIs that we think are no longer relevant to be deleted. It doesn't list fields and screensaver codes, although they may be part of the API, because they're out of scope for this document.

### How to Read the List

It starts with the function name and where and which version range of KS it is found. It'll then tell you why it's deleted and if it's going to come back (likeliness). If said function or API has came back, it'll tell you which version, which function, and which file has it. The format is as follows:

- Name: DeletedFunction()
- Source file: SomeFile.vb
- Version range: 0.0.x.x - 0.0.y.y, where 0.0.x.x first implemented the function and 0.0.y.y doesn't have it.
- Reason for deletion: Some reason
- Likeliness to come back: Highly unlikely because blah.
- Returning version: 0.0.z.z
- Returning name: RestoredFunction()
- Returning file: SomeOtherFile.vb
- Returning mod example name: SomeMod
- Returning mod example function name: RestoredFunction()
