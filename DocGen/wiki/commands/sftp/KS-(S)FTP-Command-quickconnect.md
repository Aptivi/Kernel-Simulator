## quickconnect (S)FTP command

### Summary

Prompts you to select an address to connect to

### Description

We have implemented speed dial to the (S)FTP client to quickly connect to the last-connected (S)FTP server. This is so you don't have to repeat the `connect` command to the same server over and over.

For this, we have implemented this command for easier access to (S)FTP servers.

### Command usage

* `quickconnect`
