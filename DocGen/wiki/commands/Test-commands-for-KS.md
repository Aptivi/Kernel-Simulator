## Test shell commands

The types of the colors, which are used to display messages colorfully, are located in the ColTypes enumeration found in ColorTools.

Refer to [Events for Mod Developers](../development/Events-for-Mod-Developers.md) for the events that can be used in the `<Event>` argument.

`<ErrorType>` options:
```
S = Severe
F = Fatal
U = Unrecoverable
D = Double panic
C = Continuable
```
`<RebootTime>` is measured in seconds. It is used if `<Reboot>` is True or 1.

You can find strings inside the text files in the [Resources](https://github.com/Aptivi/NitrocidKS/tree/master/Kernel%20Simulator/Resources) folder.

Refer to [this document](../misc/Placeholders.md) for the list of placeholders.

The testing shell provides these commands:

| Command                | Description | Usage
|:-----------------------|:------------|:------
| print                  | It lets you test the `W()` call to print every text, using the lines and colors that you need. | `print <Color> <Line> <Message>`
| printf                 | It lets you test the `W()` call to print every text, using the lines and colors that you need. It has an additional feature of variables, but are not parsed yet, so they are parsed as text, but will be fixed in the upcoming release. | `printf <Color> <Line> <Variable1;Variable2;Variable3;...> <Message>`
| printd                 | It lets you send any message to the debugger, using `Wdbg()` call. It doesn't provide support for variables unlike `printdf`. It only works if you have enabled the debugger which you can enable by `debug 1`. | `printd <Message>`
