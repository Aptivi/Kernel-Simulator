## chmotd command

### Summary

You can change your message of the day

### Description

If you don't like the default message of the day that is generated by the kernel, then you can use this command to change the message and store it permanently on the config file.

It also has placeholder support, like if you have `<shortdate>` and `<longtime>` placeholders, the `<shortdate>` placeholder changes to the current system date in the MM/DD/YYYY form, and the `<longtime>` placeholder changes to the current system time in the HH:MM:SS AM/PM form. More information about placeholders are available [Placeholders](../../misc/Placeholders.md).

If no arguments are specified, the text editor shell will open to the path of MOTD text file.
