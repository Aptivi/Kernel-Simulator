## edit command

### Summary

Opens the text editor shell

### Description

If you want to edit a text document, this command will let you open the text editor shell to a specified document so you can edit it. Currently, it's on the basic stage, so it doesn't have advanced options yet.

It can also open binary files, but we don't recommend doing that, because it isn't a hex editor yet. Editing a binary file may or may not cause file corruptions. Use [hexedit](KS-Command-hexedit.md) for such tasks.

### Command usage

* `edit <file>`

### Examples

* `edit readme.txt`: Opens a text editor shell to readme.txt
