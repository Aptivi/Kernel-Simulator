## savescreen command

### Summary

Launches your current screen saver

### Description

This command can protect your LCD screen from burn-in and shows you the current screensaver that is set by you or by the kernel. However it doesn't lock the user account, so we recommend to lock your screen for any purposes, unless you're testing your own screensaver from the screensaver modfile.

### Command usage

* `savescreen`
