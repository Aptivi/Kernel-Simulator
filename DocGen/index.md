## What is Kernel Simulator?

Kernel Simulator is an application which simulates our future-planned kernel as we've imagined it. It has all the usual applications, including filesystem manipulation, kernel mods, basic scripting, and many more awesome features.

## What is this web page?
 
This webpage is not a wiki for the general use of Kernel Simulator; it's an API documentation for mod developers to be used as reference. It constantly gets updated as we push the updates to the main and servicing versions of Kernel Simulator.

If you still intend to use a documentation specific to your preferred version of KS, you may refer to the [releases](https://github.com/Aptivi/Kernel-Simulator/releases) page of the project and download the attached `0.0.x.y-doc.rar` file.

To get started using the documentation, select `KS API` from the top menu and select a namespace to get a clear overview of the API that Kernel Simulator provides.

## Feedback

If you wish to leave feedback to us about this API reference website, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Aptivi/Kernel-Simulator/issues) of the project.

If you wish to contribute to the documentation of the API, go to the Kernel Simulator source code and make your improvements there on a draft [Pull Request](https://github.com/Aptivi/Kernel-Simulator/pulls); we don't support override files that are made by clicking on `Improve this doc`.

Any meaningful contributions are welcome.
