## What is Nitrocid KS?

Nitrocid KS is an application which simulates our future-planned kernel as we've imagined it. It has all the usual applications, including filesystem manipulation, kernel mods, basic scripting, and many more awesome features.

## What is this web page?
 
This webpage is not a wiki for the general use of Nitrocid KS; it's an API documentation for mod developers to be used as reference. It constantly gets updated as we push the updates to the main and servicing versions of Nitrocid KS.

If you still intend to use a documentation specific to your preferred version of KS, you may refer to the [releases](https://github.com/Aptivi/NitrocidKS/releases) page of the project and download the attached `0.0.x.y-doc.rar` file.

To get started using the documentation, select `API Documentation` from the top menu and select a namespace to get a clear overview of the API that Nitrocid KS provides.
