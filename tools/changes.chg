Nitrocid KS 0.1.0 Beta 3 changes
================================

Released December 28th, 2023.

Nitrocid KS 0.1.0 Beta 3 comes with the black magic that gives you a ton of
amazing features and improvements that make it look like it's made from
scratch. This version is a major breakthrough over the previous beta version
of Nitrocid 0.1.0 because of a number of improvements that we had to make to
enhance the user experience.

Since Nitrocid KS 0.1.0 Beta 2 was released for testing purposes, here's a
list of changes that will surprise you:

Re-targeted .NET 8.0
--------------------

Celebrating the release of the fourth long-term support (LTS) release of the
modern .NET framework, we've updated the application and its associated
addons so that they use the .NET 8.0 framework instead of the older .NET 6.0
release. This means that Nitrocid and its addons will be able to take
advantage of the new features and improvements that .NET 8.0 brings to you.

This version now targets .NET 8.0 instead of 6.0 to benefit from the speed
improvements for the whole framework over the previous long term support
version of .NET that was released on 2021.

Simplified JSON manipulation
----------------------------

Before, there were several variants of Add and Remove commands with no way
to edit an array, an object, or a property. Now, we've added three commands
that help simplify your JSON manipulation.

  * add: Adds an array, a property, or an empty object to a target array or
    object. If the property name is specified, it adds a property with a
    value of your selected type. You can also add raw JSON contents.

  * rem: Removes an array, a property, or an empty object to a target array
    or object. If the property name is specified, it removes a property with
    a value of your selected type.

  * set: Sets a value of a target to an array, a property, or an empty
    object. You can also use raw JSON content.

This means that you don't have to jump between various steps to form a final
JSON file.

Flexible console
----------------

Resizable elements are now spread through the entire kernel and not just
screensavers. This allows this kernel to be more flexible when it comes to
console resizing. This is to make it scale more appropriately.

Alongside this, between the second beta and the third beta, we've made a
truckload of console-related improvements that make the performance like the
speed of light.

We've also implemented the screen feature, which helped making the console
more flexible than before, therefore allowing dynamic screen printing to the
console across all platforms in a light speed.

Lite and Full
-------------

Starting from this beta version of Nitrocid KS, there are two versions of the
binary copy: lite and full. The lite version comes with very basic kernel
features with no extras, and the full version adds extra features to the
kernel using a mechanism called the kernel addons.

The kernel addons add extra features to the base kernel that allow you to use
many of the common tools that are not available in the base version, such as
unit conversion, games, and playing music. This ensures that the development
is more streamlined than before.

Here are some of the addons that come with the full version of the kernel:

1) Music Player

Powered by BassBoom, you can play music right from the kernel without having
to download the standalone BassBoom music player on your system. It works on
all the platforms that have sound drivers installed, like Windows, macOS, and
Linux. The full-featured music player is built for speed and accuracy.

The music player addon allows you to play your local music files right from
the kernel from classical to hip-hop to reggae to techno and trance. It
doesn't support playing Internet music files and radio stations.

2) Contacts

Powered by VisualCard, you can manage your contacts imported right from your
VCard files. This allows you to view your contact information, such as their
phone numbers, their full name, and their addresses.

Not only can you import VCard files (single and multiple contacts with
differing VCard files), but you can also import your Android contacts right
from your contacts2.db file if you have a rooted Android device with contacts
imported. You can also import contacts using the MeCard string extracted from
the QR code of your contact.

3) ChatGPT

Powered by Semantic Kernel in association with OpenAI and ChatGPT, you can use
this AI chatbot to get assistance in almost all the queries, like getting
instructions on how to cook your food, ask it questions, and much more.

Analyzer for your Mods
----------------------

Nitrocid KS 0.1.0 Beta 3 also provides you with more than 50+ code analyzers
that detect common usage pitfalls in your kernel mods and correct your code to
use appropriate functions that are better alternatives, such as replacing
plain console writes with the usage of the text writer, which gives you more
flexibility.

It's up to you if you want to enable analyzers for your mods, but we provide
you with two easy ways to analyze your mod code:

  * The standalone analyzer is a console application that allows you to analyze
    your mod code for such pitfalls. It requires .NET SDK to be installed in
    order to be able to use it.

  * The Visual Studio-based analyzer is an extension that analyzes all your
    mods to check to see if your code is declining in quality according to the
    Nitrocid KS mod coding standards.

The analyzers will keep growing up as time passes and as new versions get
released.

Interactive text and hex editor
-------------------------------

You can now interactively edit your binary and text files without any
difficulty. Just execute the "tui" command in either the console-based text or
the hex editor to start using it. This saves you time from having to manually
re-typing in commands.

The good news is that they're resizable, too! This means that you can occupy
the whole screen editing a text file or a binary file while editing it
interactively.

It not only allows you to perform standard text editor operations in these
interactive TUIs, but you can also perform advanced editing operations.

As this is one of the "Black Magic" releases, we strive to leave that as an
exercise for you to find the new features that we've added. Try to break the
